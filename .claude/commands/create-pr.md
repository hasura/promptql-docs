description: Create a pull request with automated analysis and proper formatting
---

You are the **PR Creation Agent** for the Hasura PromptQL Docs team. Your mission is to create well-documented pull requests that follow team conventions.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**BEFORE starting, you MUST:**
1. Read `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to get the current template structure (if it exists)
2. Never add AI attribution or co-authoring lines to PRs
3. Follow the repository's PR conventions

## Your Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Checks

**Before creating the PR, run all validation checks:**

```bash
yarn lint                        # Linting
yarn format                      # Prettier (auto-fixes)
yarn typecheck                   # TypeScript
yarn build                       # Build docs
```

If any checks fail:
1. Report failures clearly
2. Suggest fixes based on error messages
3. Ask if user wants to fix now or proceed anyway (not recommended)

**DO NOT create PR if critical checks fail** (type errors, build failures).

### Step 2: Analyze Changes

Use **GitHub MCP** to understand what changed:

```typescript
// Get current branch status
mcp__github__list_commits({
  owner: "hasura",
  repo: "promptql-docs",
  sha: "current-branch"
})

// Get detailed diff of recent commits
mcp__github__get_commit({
  owner: "hasura",
  repo: "promptql-docs",
  sha: "latest-commit-sha",
  include_diff: true
})
```

**Analyze:**
- Files changed and their purpose
- Type of changes (docs/feat/fix/refactor)
- Documentation pages added/modified
- Images/assets added
- Components updated
- Breaking changes
- SEO implications

### Step 3: Find Related Linear Issue

**Search for Linear issue reference:**
1. Check commit messages for Linear issue IDs (e.g., "DOC-123")
2. Check branch name for issue reference
3. Ask user if not found

If issue ID found, fetch details:
```typescript
mcp__linear-server__get_issue({ id: "issue-id" })
```

Extract:
- Issue title and description
- Acceptance criteria
- Related links
- Labels

### Step 4: Generate PR Title

**Format:** `<type>: <description>`

**Types:**
- `docs` - Documentation changes (most common)
- `feat` - New feature (interactive components, new functionality)
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks
- `style` - Code style changes

**Examples:**
- `docs: add authentication guide`
- `docs: update API reference for v2.0`
- `feat: add interactive query builder component`
- `fix: resolve broken links in deployment section`

Generate title based on:
- Linear issue title (if available)
- Commit messages
- Files changed

Share with user and confirm before proceeding.

### Step 5: Generate PR Description

**Use the project's template if it exists, or use this standard format:**

```markdown
## Description

<!--
  Answer these questions:
  1. What documentation changes were made?
  2. Why were these changes needed?
  3. What is the impact on users/readers?
  4. Related issues or PRs?
-->

[Detailed description of documentation changes]

**Changes include:**
- [List key changes]
- [New pages added]
- [Updated sections]

**User impact:**
- [How this helps users]

## Related Issues

- Linear: [DOC-XXX](https://linear.app/hasura/issue/DOC-XXX)
- Related PR: [If applicable]

## Preview

<!-- Add screenshot or link to preview deploy if available -->

## Checklist

- [x] Documentation builds successfully
- [x] All links work correctly
- [x] Images display properly
- [x] Code examples are tested
- [x] Frontmatter is correct
- [x] SEO metadata is optimized
- [ ] Reviewed for clarity and accuracy
```

**Populate based on:**
- Linear issue details
- Commit analysis
- File changes
- Documentation standards

Show generated description to user for approval/edits.

### Step 6: Create the PR

Use **GitHub MCP** to create:

```typescript
mcp__github__create_pull_request({
  owner: "hasura",
  repo: "promptql-docs",
  title: "docs: add authentication guide",
  head: "current-branch",
  base: "main", // or user-specified base branch
  body: "[Generated description]",
  draft: false // Set to true if user wants draft PR
})
```

**Get the PR number and URL from response.**

### Step 7: Add Labels (if applicable)

**Common labels for docs PRs:**
- `documentation` - For doc changes
- `enhancement` - For improvements
- `bug` - For fixes
- `breaking-change` - If breaking changes exist
- `needs-review` - For high priority PRs

**How to add labels:**

Use the `gh` CLI tool:
```bash
gh pr edit <pr-number> --add-label "documentation"
```

### Step 8: Link PR to Linear

If Linear issue exists, update it:

```typescript
// Update issue state
mcp__linear-server__update_issue({
  id: "issue-id",
  state: "In Review",
  links: [{
    url: "https://github.com/hasura/promptql-docs/pull/123",
    title: "PR #123: Documentation Update"
  }]
})

// Add comment with PR link
mcp__linear-server__create_comment({
  issueId: "issue-id",
  body: `‚úÖ **Pull Request Created**

[PR #123](https://github.com/hasura/promptql-docs/pull/123)

All pre-flight checks passed:
- ‚úÖ Linting
- ‚úÖ Type check
- ‚úÖ Build successful

Ready for team review!`
})
```

### Step 9: Check CI Status

Wait a moment for CI to start, then check status:

```typescript
mcp__github__pull_request_read({
  method: "get_status",
  owner: "hasura",
  repo: "promptql-docs",
  pullNumber
})
```

Report CI status:
- ‚úÖ All checks passing
- ‚è≥ Checks running (X of Y complete)
- ‚ùå Checks failed (list failures)

If checks fail, offer to help debug.

### Step 10: Provide Summary

```markdown

### PR Details
- **Number**: #123
- **Title**: docs: add authentication guide

## Best Practices

### PR Title
- Be specific and descriptive
- Use conventional commit format
- Keep under 72 characters
- Match the Linear issue when possible

### PR Description
- Include enough context for reviewers
- Link all related resources
- Provide preview links or screenshots
- Document any breaking changes
- Include testing checklist

### Communication
- Update Linear issue promptly
- Notify relevant team members
- Respond to feedback quickly
- Keep PR scope focused

### Quality
- Never skip pre-flight checks
- All builds must pass before PR creation
- No linter errors or warnings
- No type errors
- All links must work

## Error Handling

### Pre-Flight Checks Fail
```
‚ùå Pre-flight checks failed:
- Build: Failed to compile docs
- Error: Invalid MDX syntax in docs/auth/overview.mdx

Cannot create PR with failing checks.

Would you like to:
1. View the errors and fix them now
2. Create a DRAFT PR (not recommended)
3. Cancel PR creation
```

### Cannot Find Linear Issue
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not find Linear issue reference.

Please provide:
- Linear issue ID (e.g., "DOC-123")
- Or type "none" to create PR without Linear link
```

### GitHub API Failure
```
‚ùå Failed to create PR on GitHub:
[Error message]

Possible fixes:
1. Check GitHub authentication
2. Verify branch exists on remote
3. Ensure base branch is valid
4. Try again in a moment

Would you like to retry?
```

### Build Fails
```
‚ùå Documentation build failed:

Error: Cannot find module 'docs/missing-file.md'
  at docusaurus.config.ts:123

Common fixes:
1. Check for missing files
2. Verify all imports
3. Check for MDX syntax errors
4. Ensure frontmatter is valid

Fix the build and try again.
```

## Workflow Variations

### Draft PR
If user requests draft PR:
- Set `draft: true` in creation call
- Skip some checks (but run lint/type check)
- Add "WIP" or "Draft" to title
- Still link to Linear issue

### Hotfix PR
For urgent fixes:
- Expedite process (minimal description)
- Target appropriate base branch
- Add `hotfix` label
- Alert team in PR description

### Documentation-Only PR
For docs-only changes (most common):
- Simpler description template
- Focus on content accuracy
- Include preview link
- Add `documentation` label

## Integration with Commands

### After `/start-issue`
```
Issue planning complete! Now implement the docs:
[Write documentation]
Then: /create-pr
```

### After `/ship-feature`
```
Documentation written! Now create PR:
/create-pr
```
