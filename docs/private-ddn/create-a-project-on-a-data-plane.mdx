# Create a Project on a Data Plane

## Introduction

:::tip Important

This guide will walk you through the steps for creating a project on a Data Plane in
[Private Hasura DDN](/private-ddn/index.mdx). Before proceeding, you'll first need to be
[invited](/private-ddn/data-plane-collaboration.mdx) to a Data Plane.

If you are unable to meet the prerequisites listed below or your data source is inaccessible from the location where you
run DDN CLI commands, consider using a [DDN Workspace](/private-ddn/ddn-workspace.mdx) instead.

## Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```ddn title="Being by authenticating your CLI seession:"
ddn auth login
```

A browser window will open and prompt you for your login credentials. After successfully logging in, you'll be able to
return to the CLI.

The DDN CLI will scaffold out all the necessary files and directories for your project.

## Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```ddn title="Next, create a new local project and pass your data plane's ID:"
ddn supergraph init my-project --with-promptql --project-data-plane-id <data-plane-id> && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running ls in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

## Step 3. Add a data source

The command below will launch a wizard via the DDN CLI which will assist you in adding a data connector. You can learn
more about adding sources via data connectors [here](/data-sources/connect-to-a-source.mdx).

```ddn title="Add a data source using the CLI:"
ddn connector init <connector_name> -i
```

This will provision the necessary files — using your configuration — for connecting a data source to your supergraph
API.

:::info Organize your data into subgraphs

You can also organize your API into **subgraphs**. Subgraphs are generally organized around team functions or business
outcomes and allow for independent ownership and governance of data sources. Learn more
[here](/project-configuration/subgraphs/index.mdx).

## Step 4. Generate your metadata

```ddn title="First, introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```ddn title="Then, generate the metadata:"
ddn model add <connector_name> '*'
ddn command add <connector_name> '*'
ddn relationship add <connector_name> '*'
```

You'll see metadata files generated for each entity in your data source. You can learn more [here](/metadata/index.mdx).

## Step 5. Create a new local build

```ddn title="You can now create a local build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```ddn title="Then run your local services, including the Hasura DDN Engine and your connector(s):"
ddn run docker-start
```

```ddn title="Finally, open the local development console usign the CLI:"
ddn console --local
```

The development console will open wherein you can now chat with your data.

## Step 6. Build and deploy your supergraph

When you're ready, you can create a cloud build.

```ddn title="Build and deploy you supergraph:"
ddn supergraph build create
```

When this process is complete, the CLI will return a link to the hosted application where you can run talk to your data.
