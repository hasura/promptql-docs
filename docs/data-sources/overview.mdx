# Basics

## What is a data source?

In PromptQL, a data source is anything you can ask questions about.

That includes traditional databases like Postgres and MySQL, but also REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and even custom
functions or services. If it returns data, it can be a data source.

## How do I connect my data (and what happens next)?

We use **native data connectors** to make your data accessible through PromptQL. These connectors are designed for
specific systems: relational databases, NoSQL, REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and more.

Once your data sources are connected, PromptQL acts as the interface. You ask a question in plain language, and PromptQL
figures out what data it needs, pulls the right pieces from one or more sources, and assembles an accurate, reliable
result.

You don't need to worry about where the data lives â€” PromptQL can traverse across your connected sources to answer your
question.

You can get started by choosing one of the supported connectors:

- Amazon Athena
- Amazon Redshift
- BigQuery
- Databricks
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Snowflake
- TypeScript Lambda
- Python Lambda
- Go Lambda

## Building your own connector

If you're working with a custom data source, you can create your own connector. The
[NDC Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec) describes how this works, and we offer SDKs and a full tutorial to guide
you.
