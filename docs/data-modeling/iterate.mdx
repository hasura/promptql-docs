# Iterate on your Data Model

After you have successfully created a DDN supergraph to use with PromptQL, you will soon want to iterate on your data
model to reflect changes in the underlying data sources

## Changing your underlying data model

Depending on your data source, you may be adding a column to a table in PostgreSQL, or a creating a new collection in
MongoDB. You may have written new custom logic in TypeScript or want to import a new command from the Stripe connector.
Whatever it is, you will follow the same steps each time anything changes in your data source schema to iterate on your
data model.

## Re-introspecting your data model

Re-introspecting your data model will update the connector configuration to reflect the changes in your data sources.

```sh
ddn connector introspect my_connector
```

## Viewing resources

```sh title="You can then view the resources that have been discovered by running:"
ddn connector show-resources my_connector
```

## Adding resources

```sh title="And add precisely the resources you need running any of the following commands with real values:"
ddn model add my_connector my_model
ddn command add my_connector my_command
ddn relationship add my_connector my_relationship
```

```sh title="Or if you want to add all resources:"
ddn model add my_connector "*"
ddn command add my_connector "*"
ddn relationship add my_connector "*"
```

## Adding semantic Information

It's highly recommended to provide extra natural language descriptions of the resources in your project so that the
PromptQL can better understand your data and create appropriate query plans.

The description field can be added to `Model`, `Command` and `Relationship` metadata elements to provide semantic
context. See more about [semantic information here](/data-modeling/semantic-information.mdx).

## Building a new supergraph

```sh title="You can then build a new local supergraph by running:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::info Build for Hasura Cloud

You can also build a new supergraph for a project on Hasura Cloud:

If you don't have a project on Hasura Cloud, you can create one by running:

```sh
ddn project init
```

Then:

```sh
ddn supergraph build create
```

:::

## Restarting services locally

If you are iterating locally, you then need to restart the Docker services by running:

```sh
ddn run docker-start
```
