# Relationships Connect Data

## Introduction

Relationships allow you to connect your data, enabling PromptQL to understand the semantic connections between your data
entities and accurately talk to all your data. By defining these relationships, PromptQL can generate intelligent query
plans that navigate complex data structures to provide meaningful insights.

Examples of how PromptQL uses relationships to deliver powerful insights:

- When asking PromptQL about a customer's purchasing patterns, it can understand the relationship between `Customer`,
  their `Orders`, and each `Product` item in those orders, delivering comprehensive purchasing analysis. (Model to
  Model)
- When requesting customer behavior analytics, PromptQL can correlate a `Customer` with their app usage metrics from
  another data source, providing cross-data-source insights. (Model to Model in another subgraph or data connector)
- When analyzing international sales performance, PromptQL can combine `Order` data with live currency conversions from
  an external API through a lambda data connector, delivering real-time financial analysis. (Model to Command)

Relationships can be added between _any_ kind of semantically related models and/or commands. They do not need to be
related in the data source by, for example, a foreign key. They also do not need to be backed by the same data source or
be in the same subgraph.

## Lifecycle

Many relationships can be created automatically by the DDN CLI from detected underlying connections such as foreign
keys. In such cases the lifecycle in creating a relationship in your metadata is as follows:

1. Introspect your data source using the DDN CLI with the relevant data connector to fetch the entity resources.
2. Add the detected relationships to your metadata with the DDN CLI.
3. Create a build of your supergraph API with the DDN CLI.
4. Serve your build to enable PromptQL to access your data with the Hasura engine either locally or in the cloud.
5. Iterate on your PromptQL experience by repeating this process or by editing your metadata manually as needed.

If the relationship cannot be detected automatically, you can easily manually create a relationship in your metadata and
then perform lifecycle steps 3-5 from above as needed.

## Create a relationship

Relationships are defined in metadata from an
[object type](/reference/metadata-reference/types.mdx#objecttype-objecttype), to a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx) or [command](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx). But since
models and commands are also defined with object types, you can think of relationships as being between models and/or
commands.

The target command can be enabled with a custom piece of business logic on a lambda data connector, or a native mutation
operation.

### Using the DDN CLI

The DDN CLI and your data connectors will detect many relationships in your data sources automatically, for instance
from foreign keys in a relational database, and once introspected, you can add them to your metadata.

```bash title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Show the found relationships:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Add a relationship to your metadata:"
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

Or optionally add all relationships found for a connector at once:

```bash
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> "*"
```

:::info Context for CLI commands

Note that the above CLI commands work without also adding the relevant subgraph to the command with the `--subgraph`
flag because this has been set in the CLI context. You can learn more about creating and switching contexts in the
[CLI context](/) section. {/* TODO: Add link */}

### Manually creating a relationship

Relationships can also be manually added to your metadata.

The [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) can help you to author
relationships.

For example, you can configure a relationship so that when a user asks PromptQL about a Customer's purchasing history,
it can also access their Orders data.

```yaml title="Create a relationship in your metadata:"
---
kind: Relationship
version: v1
definition:
  sourceType: Customers # The existing source object type which also defines the model
  name: orders # A name we want to use when we query the Orders from the Customer
  target:
    model: # The target can be a model or a command
      name: Orders # The existing model that we want to access when we query the Orders from the Customer
      relationshipType: Array # The relationship type which can be Object or Array. Since a customer can have many orders, we use an Array.
  mapping: # The mapping defines which field on the source object type maps to which field on the target model
    - source:
        fieldPath:
          - fieldName: customerId # The existing field on the source object type that we want to map to the target model
      target:
        modelField:
          - fieldName: customerId # The existing field on the target model that we want to map to the source object type
```

By defining this `Relationship` object, PromptQL will understand that customers and orders are connected, allowing it to
generate accurate query plans that can navigate from customer data to their associated orders when responding to user
queries about customer purchasing behavior.

## Update a relationship

Your underlying data source may change over time. You can update your relationship to reflect these changes.

If you have an automatically detected relationship and a property on the source object type has changed, you can update
the relationship to reflect this change.

First, update your connector configuration and models.

```bash title="Update your source introspection:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```bash title="Then, update your model:"
ddn model update <connector_name> <model_name>
```

Now, you can either delete the existing `Relationship` object and use the DDN CLI to add it again:

```bash title="Delete your existing relationship manually and add it again:"
ddn relationship add <connector_link_name> <collection_name>
```

Or you can update the `Relationship` object manually. Learn more about the
[Relationship](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx) object.

## Delete a relationship

If you no longer need a relationship, simply delete the `Relationship` metadata object manually. It is fully
self-contained.

## Reference

You can learn more about relationships in the metadata reference
[docs](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx).
