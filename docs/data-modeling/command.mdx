# Commands Enable PromptQL to Modify Data

## Introduction

Commands are a crucial component that enable PromptQL to take action on your data. While PromptQL can intelligently
query your data through natural language conversations, commands allow it to go further by modifying data (inserts,
updates, deletes), executing complex operations, or implementing custom business logic across your connected data
sources.

When a user requests changes to their data through PromptQL, the system dynamically builds a query plan that
incorporates these commands as part of its execution strategy, providing high accuracy and detailed explanations of each
action taken.

## Lifecycle

When setting up commands for use with PromptQL, follow this lifecycle:

1. Have some operation in your data source that you want to make executable via PromptQL.
2. Introspect your data source using the CLI with the relevant data connector to fetch the operation resources.
3. Add the command to your metadata with the CLI.
4. Create a build with the CLI.
5. Serve your build via the packaged distributed query engine, either locally or in the cloud.
6. Interact with your data through PromptQL, which can now execute these commands as part of its dynamic query planning.

## Create a command

To add a command you will need to have a data connector already set up and connected to the data source. Follow the
[Quickstart](/quickstart.mdx) or the tutorial in [How to Build with DDN](/how-to-build-with-promptql/index.mdx) to get
to that point.

### From a source operation

Some data connectors support the ability to introspect your data source to discover the commands that can be added to
your metadata layer automatically.

```ddn title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```ddn title="Show the resources discovered from your data source:"
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

```ddn title="Add the command from the discovered resources to your metadata:"
ddn command add <connector_link_name> <operation_name>
```

Or you can optionally add all the commands by specifying `"*"`.

```ddn title="Add all commands from your data source:"
ddn command add <connector_link_name> "*"
```

This will add commands with their accompanying metadata definitions to your metadata.

### Via native operations {#via-native-operations-how-to}

Some data connectors support the ability to add commands via native operations so that you can add any operation that is
not supported by the automatic introspection process.

For classic database connectors, this will be native query code for that source. This can be, for example, a more
complex read operation or a way to run custom business logic, which PromptQL can incorporate into its query plan.

For Lambda connectors, eg: (TypeScript, Go, Python, etc) this will be a function (read-only) or procedure (mutation or
other side-effects) that PromptQL can use to execute specialized operations on your data.

<Tabs groupId="source-preference" className="api-tabs">
  <TabItem value="TypeScript" label="Node.js TypeScript">
    <CommandCreateLambdaTypescriptNativeOperationHowTo />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python">
    <CommandCreateLambdaPythonNativeOperationHowTo />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Go" label="Go">
    <CommandCreateLambdaGoNativeOperationHowTo />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once set up, PromptQL will automatically consider these commands when generating query plans based on user requests,
enabling accurate data modifications and complex operations through natural language interactions.

## Update a command

When your underlying data source changes, you'll need to update the commands available to PromptQL to ensure continued
accuracy in its operations:

```ddn title="Introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```ddn title="Then, update your existing command:"
ddn command update <connector_link_name> <command_name>
```

You will see an output which explains how new resources were added or updated in the command.

After updating, PromptQL will automatically incorporate these changes into its query planning, ensuring that user
interactions with their data remain accurate and up-to-date.

You can also update the command by editing the command's metadata manually.

## Delete a command

```ddn title="If you no longer need a command, you can delete it:"
ddn command remove <command_name>
```

Along with the command itself, the associated metadata is also removed, and PromptQL will no longer include this command
in its query planning.

## Reference

You can learn more about commands in the metadata reference [docs](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx).
