# Recast Types

## Overview

At times, your database schema may not perfectly align with how you want to expose data types in your API. For example,
you might have text fields that contain numeric values, JSON fields you want to filter as strings, or custom database
types that would work better as standard types in your API.

Your semantic metadata layer allows you to recast these types without requiring any changes to your underlying
datasource schema. This powerful feature enables you to unlock type-specific operations like numeric aggregations on
text fields or string filtering on JSON data, all through simple metadata configuration changes.

## Step 1. Update the representation mapping

In the `<connector-name>-types.hml` file for your connector, you'll find definitions and mappings for your data source's
types. For the type you wish to recast, you'll need to identify the correct `DataConnectorScalarRepresentation` and
change the value for the `representation` key.

If you don't know which types are available when recasting, trigger the
[Hasura VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) by pressing
`CTRL+SPACEBAR`. Check out the example below.

```yaml title="Here we'll change a text type (represented as a string):" {6}
kind: DataConnectorScalarRepresentation
version: v1
definition:
  dataConnectorName: pg
  dataConnectorScalarType: text
  representation: string
  graphql:
    comparisonExpressionTypeName: string_comparison_exp
```

```yaml title="To an int:" {6,8}
kind: DataConnectorScalarRepresentation
version: v1
definition:
  dataConnectorName: pg
  dataConnectorScalarType: text
  representation: int32
  graphql:
    comparisonExpressionTypeName: text_as_int32_comparison_exp
```

:::tip Comparison Expression Type

We're also amending the `comparisonExpressionTypeName` as these must be unique.

## Step 2. Regenerate your metadata

```ddn title="Update your metadata by running the following:"
ddn model add <connector-name> "*"
```

This will update your metadata to use the new type; you'll find changes in both the `<connector-name>-types.hml` file
for various expressions (such as aggregates and boolean) and any models which use the recast type.

## Step 3. Test it out

```ddn title="Rebuild your metadata:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```ddn title="Then, restart your services:"
ddn run docker-start
```

If you explore your metadata, you'll see the type recast, allowing you to perform operations that weren't previously
possible.
