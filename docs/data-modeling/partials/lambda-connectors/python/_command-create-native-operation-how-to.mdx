You can create Python connectors with custom code to enhance PromptQL's ability to talk to all your data. These
connectors become available in your supergraph, allowing PromptQL to include them in its dynamic query plans.

```ddn title="Initialize a new connector and select hasura/python from the list:"
ddn connector init my_py -i
```

```py title="Replace the functions.py contents with your own custom code:"
from hasura_ndc import start
from hasura_ndc.function_connector import FunctionConnector

connector = FunctionConnector()

@connector.register_query
def my_custom_code(my_input: str) -> str:
  # Do something with the input
  return "My output"

if __name__ == "__main__":
  start(connector)
```

When you add the `@connector.register_query` decorator, you're creating a function that PromptQL can access as part of
its query planning. If you use `@connector.register_mutation` instead, the function will be available for data
modification operations in PromptQL's query plans.

```ddn title="Introspect the connector:"
ddn connector introspect my_py
```

```ddn title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_py my_custom_code
```

```ddn title="Create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```ddn title="Start your services:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```ddn title="Open your development console:"
ddn console --local
```

```graphql title="You can now query your native operation:"
query MyCustomCode {
  myCustomCode(myInput: "My input")
}
```

By extending your supergraph with custom Python connectors, you give PromptQL the ability to perform specialized
operations that go beyond standard data access, enabling more powerful and flexible interactions with your data.
