You can create custom TypeScript functions in your connector to expand PromptQL's capabilities, enabling it to interact
with your data in more sophisticated ways through natural language conversations.

```ddn title="Initalize a new connector and select hasura/nodejs from the list:"
ddn connector init my_ts -i
```

```ts title="Replace the functions.ts contents with your own custom code:"
/**
 * @readonly
 */
export function myCustomCode(myInput: string): string {
  // Do something with the input
  return "My output";
}
```

The `@readonly` tag indicates this function is a read-only operation. PromptQL will recognize this as a data retrieval
function when building query plans. Without this tag, PromptQL will treat it as an action that can modify data.

```ddn title="Introspect the connector:"
ddn connector introspect my_ts
```

```ddn title="Track the function:"
ddn command add my_ts myCustomCode
```

```ddn title="Create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```ddn title="Start your services:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```ddn title="Open your development console:"
ddn console --local
```

Once set up, you can interact with your custom function through PromptQL conversations.

By adding custom functions to your supergraph, you extend PromptQL's capabilities to talk to your data in ways specific
to your business needs.
