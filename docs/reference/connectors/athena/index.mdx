Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Amazon Athena, providing integration with data in Amazon S3. This
connector allows you to leverage Athena's powerful OLAP capabilities while taking advantage of Hasura’s metadata-driven
approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the Amazon Athena connector and walk through the configuration process
within a Hasura DDN project.
