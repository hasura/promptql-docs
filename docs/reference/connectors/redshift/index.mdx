# Amazon Redshift

## Introduction

Hasura DDN includes a Native Data Connector for Amazon Redshift, providing integration with petabyte-scale data
warehouses. This connector allows you to leverage Redshift's powerful OLAP capabilities while taking advantage of
Hasura’s metadata-driven approach. Here, we’ll explore the key features of the Amazon Redshift connector and walk
through the configuration process within a Hasura DDN project.
