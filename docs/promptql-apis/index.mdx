# PromptQL APIs

## Introduction

End users can interact with a PromptQL application via the PromptQL Playground—our built-in GUI—but, PromptQL APIs let
you embed AI-native features—like natural language querying and intelligent program execution—directly into your app,
powered by Hasura DDN.

## Available APIs

- **[Natural Language API](/promptql-apis/natural-language-api.mdx)** - Enable conversational access to your data. This
  API lets you send user messages, stream assistant responses, and manage artifacts like text and tables as part of the
  interaction.

- **[Execute Program API](/promptql-apis/execute-program-api.mdx)** - Run exported PromptQL programs with your data
  using a single endpoint. This API is ideal for more structured interactions or automations.

- **[Threads API](/promptql-apis/threads-api.mdx)** - Manage conversation threads, including creating, retrieving,
  updating, and deleting threads. Also includes functionality for sharing threads, managing pinned threads, and
  collecting feedback.

- **[Automations API](/promptql-apis/automations-api.mdx)** - Create, manage, and execute automations that can process
  table data with simplified input formats. Perfect for building automated workflows and data processing pipelines.

- **[Schedules API](/promptql-apis/schedules-api.mdx)** - Create and manage scheduled executions of automations and
  recurring tasks. Set up automated workflows that run at specific times or intervals using cron expressions.

- **[User Artifacts API](/promptql-apis/user-artifacts-api.mdx)** - Upload, manage, and download files and artifacts
  within your PromptQL projects. Supports binary data upload with metadata, versioning, and visibility controls.

- **[Autograph Requests API](/promptql-apis/autograph-requests-api.mdx)** - Manage approval workflows for sensitive
  operations. Enables administrators to review, approve, or deny requests from collaborators for protected actions.

- **[System APIs](/promptql-apis/system-apis.mdx)** - Utility endpoints for health checks, version information, and
  capability discovery. Essential for monitoring, debugging, and understanding your PromptQL instance.

Each API is backed by Hasura DDN, meaning you can connect your own project, pass context via artifacts, and control
behavior using system instructions and customizations.
