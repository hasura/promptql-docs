# Execute Program API

## Introduction

Under the hood, PromptQL utilizes a set of built-in primitives, in conjunction with any
[custom business logic](/business-logic/overview.mdx) you've provided, to create small programs on top of your data.

These primitives pair relevant data or artifacts—represented as `inputs` or `data`—from your application with on-the-fly
and context-aware `instructions` based on the thread between the user and PromptQL.

### Summarize

```python title="Example:"
summaries = executor.summarize(
    instructions="""
    Create a concise summary of each reservation focusing on:
    - The restaurant name
    - Any special notes or important details
    Keep each summary to 1-2 sentences.
    """,
    inputs=reservation_texts
)
```

### Extract

```python title="Example:"
extracted_info = executor.extract(
        json_schema=json_schema,
        instructions="""
        Extract any mentioned dietary requirements, special occasions, or seating preferences from the reservation notes.
        For dietary requirements, include any allergies, restrictions, or preferences mentioned.
        For special occasions, look for mentions of birthdays, anniversaries, celebrations etc.
        For seating preferences, identify if they specifically requested indoor, outdoor, bar seating etc.
        If any field is not mentioned, omit it from the output.
        """,
        inputs=notes_to_extract
    )
```

### Classify

```python title="Example:"
classifications = executor.classify(
    instructions="""
    Categorize each restaurant based on its name and any available description.
    A restaurant can belong to multiple categories.
    Consider both the dining style (Fine Dining, Casual) and cuisine type.
    Examples:
    - A high-end Italian restaurant would be both "Fine Dining" and "Italian"
    - A casual American pub would be both "Casual Dining" and "American"
    """,
    categories=categories,
    allow_multiple=True,
    inputs=unique_restaurants
)
```

### Visualize

```python title="Example:"
viz_result = executor.visualize(
    instructions="""
    Create an interactive bar chart showing the distribution of restaurant categories.
    Requirements:
    - Use a horizontal bar chart for better readability of category names
    - Sort bars by count in descending order
    - Use a pleasant color scheme (preferably blues or teals)
    - Include hover tooltips showing exact count
    - Add a clear title 'Restaurant Categories Distribution'
    - Make the chart responsive to container width
    - Include total number of restaurants in each category
    """,
    data=viz_data
)
```

:::info Think of this as a toolbox

Each primitive is a specialized tool designed to perform a specific task on your data. They're flexible, composable, and
context-aware, letting you build intelligent workflows by combining natural language instructions with structured input.

As you add your own custom business logic, you're providing more specific tools to PromptQL.

      "msg": "error message",
      "type": "error_type"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes for using the Execute Program API

1. **Program Code**

   - Ensure your PromptQL program code is properly formatted and tested
   - You can export working programs from the PromptQL playground using the "Export as API" button

2. **Artifacts**

   - Provide all necessary artifacts that your program needs to run
   - Make sure artifact identifiers match those referenced in your program code
   - Both text and table artifacts are supported

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always check the error field in the response
   - Implement appropriate retry logic for transient failures
   - Validate your inputs against the API schema to catch issues early

## Get PromptQL programs from the playground

You can get PromptQL programs from PromptQL playground interactions by clicking on the "Export as API" button next to
the Query Plan in the playground.
