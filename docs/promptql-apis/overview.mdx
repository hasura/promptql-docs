# PromptQL APIs

## Introduction

Typically, you'll interact with a PromptQL application via PromptQL Playground — our built-in GUI — but, PromptQL APIs
let you embed AI-native features — like natural language querying and intelligent program execution — directly into your
app, powered by Hasura DDN. Whether you're building chat-based experiences or running exported PromptQL programs, these
flexible endpoints make it easy to create interactive, dynamic, and intelligent data flows.

## Available APIs

- **[Natural Language API](/promptql-apis/natural-language-api.mdx)** - Enable conversational access to your data. This
  API lets you send user messages, stream assistant responses, and manage artifacts like text and tables as part of the
  interaction.

- **[Execute Program API](/promptql-apis/execute-program-api.mdx)** - Run exported PromptQL programs with your data
  using a single endpoint. This API is ideal for more structured interactions or automations.

Each API is backed by Hasura DDN, meaning you can connect your own project, pass context via artifacts, and control
behavior using system instructions and customizations.
