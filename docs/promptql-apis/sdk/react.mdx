# React SDK

## Introduction

The React SDK is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promptql-chat-sdk). This SDK is built for simplified and
bespoke **chat interfaces** and doesn't have parity to the Playground experience (generation and downloading of
artifacts).

## Install

```sh title="The SDK can be installed using npm:"
npm install promptql-chat-sdk
```

## Connect

```tsx title="You'll connect by creating a drop-in chat component:"
import { PromptQLChat } from "promptql-chat-sdk";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Application</h1>
      <PromptQLChat endpoint="http://localhost:8080" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::info Requires a Proxy Server

The SDK requires a proxy server to handle authentication. The endpoint should point to your proxy server that forwards
requests to the PromptQL API with the necessary authentication headers.
[See examples](https://github.com/hasura/promptql-chat-sdk/blob/main/proxy-examples/README.md).

:::

## Usage

The SDK provides three integration approaches:

- **Drop-in Component** - Complete chat interface with a single component
- **Component Library** - Individual components for custom layouts
- **Headless Hook** - Full UI control with state management

For detailed documentation, examples, and API reference, see the
[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promptql-chat-sdk).
