# With Persistent Datasources

The content of this guide is identical to our [quickstart](/quickstart.mdx). It provides you with a quick and easy guide
to get up-and-running with single datasource while also incorporating custom business logic so that PromptQL can take
action on a user's behalf.

You'll use a hosted PostgreSQL database pre-loaded with IMDb movie data. You'll be able to chat with the data to explore
information about different movies. Then, you'll add custom business logic that lets PromptQL take action â€” like renting
a movie on a user's behalf.
