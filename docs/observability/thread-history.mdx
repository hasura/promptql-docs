# Thread History

## Introduction

As an admin user, you can access the complete history of all threads created within your project. This powerful feature
allows you to monitor conversations, review interactions, and gain insights into how users are engaging with your data.

- View all threads from every user in your project
- Access complete conversation history in read-only mode
- Filter and search through threads to find specific interactions
- Analyze usage patterns and identify common queries

## Accessing Thread History

Navigate to the **Insights** tab in your project dashboard, then select the **Thread History** section to view all
threads.

## Admin Capabilities

This feature is only available to users with the `admin` role. As an admin, you can view threads in read-only mode. This
ensures that the original conversations remain intact while still providing complete visibility into how users are
interacting with your data.

This feature is particularly valuable for:

- Troubleshooting user issues
- Identifying common usage patterns
- Improving data models based on user queries
- Monitoring for potential misuse or security concerns

## Requirements

- PromptQL must be enabled for your project
- Admin privileges required
- Threads retained based on your data retention policy
