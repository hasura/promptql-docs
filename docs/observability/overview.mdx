# Observability

Observability with PromptQL provides deep insights into your application's performance, user interactions, and system
health. These features help you understand how your applications are being used, identify performance bottlenecks, and
troubleshoot issues effectively.

Navigate to the **Insights** tab in your project dashboard to access all observability features. The available tabs
depend on your project configuration and user permissions.
