# PromptQL Traces

## Introduction

PromptQL traces provide detailed execution monitoring for your PromptQL API operations using OpenTelemetry format. Track
thread interactions, API requests, and performance metrics to debug issues and optimize your AI-powered applications.

PromptQL traces capture:

- Thread operations (start, continue)
- API requests (natural language queries, program execution)
- Request duration and status
- Thread and trace relationships

## Accessing traces

Navigate to the **Insights** tab in your project dashboard, then select **PromptQL Traces**.

The traces table displays the following columns:

- **Trace ID** - Unique identifier for the trace (clickable to view details)
- **Thread ID** - Associated thread identifier or operation type for API requests
- **Operation** - The specific PromptQL operation performed:
  - `Start thread` - New thread creation
  - `Continue thread` - Thread continuation
  - `Execute Program` - Program execution API call
  - `Natural Language Query` - Query API call
- **Duration** - Execution time in seconds
- **Start Time** - When the operation occurred (local timezone)
- **Status** - Success (green checkmark) or Error (red warning)

:::info Filtering & Search

Filter traces by request type (Requests/Errors), search by Thread ID or Trace ID, and select custom date ranges.

### Overview section

The overview section includes general information, such as the thread's ID, its start time, and the duration.

### Execution waterfall

The execution section shows:

- **Span hierarchy** - Visual representation of trace spans
- **Timing information** - Duration and timing for each span
- **Error details** - Stack traces and error messages for failed operations
- **Performance metrics** - Detailed timing breakdown

## Requirements

- PromptQL must be enabled for your project
- Valid project FQDN required for trace collection
- Traces are retained based on your data retention policy
