# Chat History

## Introduction

As an admin user, you can access the complete history of all chats created within your project via the **PromptQL
Playground**. This powerful feature allows you to monitor conversations, review interactions, and gain insights into how
users are engaging with your data.

- View all chats from every user in your project
- Access complete conversation history in read-only mode
- Filter and search through chats to find specific interactions
- Analyze usage patterns and identify common queries

## Access Chat history

Navigate to the **Insights** tab in your project dashboard, then select the **Chat History** section to view all chats.

## Admin capabilities

This feature is only available to users with the `admin` role. As an admin, you can view chats in read-only mode. This
ensures that the original conversations remain intact while still providing complete visibility into how users are
interacting with your data.

This feature is particularly valuable for:

- Troubleshooting user issues
- Identifying common usage patterns
- Improving data models based on user queries
- Monitoring for potential misuse or security concerns

## Requirements

- PromptQL must be enabled for your project
- Admin privileges required
- Chats retained based on your data retention policy
