## Grafana integration

The monitoring page includes embedded Grafana dashboards that are fully hosted and managed for you. You don’t need to
worry about setting up Grafana or handling authentication—it’s all managed automatically. These dashboards provide
complete access to Grafana features and adjust responsively to your screen size, making it easy to explore performance
metrics across any device.

## Dashboard features

Within the embedded Grafana interface, you can take full advantage of standard features. Choose custom time ranges to
zoom in on specific performance windows, interact with panels to drill into metrics, use dashboard variables for
filtering, and control how often data refreshes—whether manually or on a schedule.

## Common metrics

The dashboards help you track essential performance indicators. These include the rate of incoming requests per second,
average and percentile-based response times, and the percentage of failed requests. You can also monitor system-level
metrics like CPU load, memory usage, and storage consumption to keep tabs on infrastructure health.

## Dashboard management

Out of the box, dashboards are pre-configured and available as soon as monitoring is enabled—no setup required. If you
need to go beyond the defaults, you can create and manage your own custom dashboards directly within the hosted Grafana
environment.
