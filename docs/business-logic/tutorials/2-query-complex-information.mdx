# Return Complex Information

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll use a lambda connector to add custom business logic to your application and retrieve
information.

This tutorial should take about five minutes.

:::info Should you use a native data connector instead?

We've developed a set of native data connectors that make it easy to retrieve data from specific sources. You can learn
more [here](/data-sources/overview.mdx).

This guide is intended to illustrate use cases wherein a native data connector doesn't exist for your source, or you
need to do custom transformations of the data before its returned to your application.
