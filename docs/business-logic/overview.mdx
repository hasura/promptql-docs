# Business Logic

You can use lambda connectors to give PromptQL abilities to execute custom business logic on behalf of the user. We can
add a lamdba connector runtime in Node.js with **TypeScript**, **Python**, or **Go**, and expose functions to PromptQL
as tools it can use. This means PromptQL isn't limited to querying data â€” it can **trigger logic**, **run workflows**,
or **transform inputs into actions and automations**.
