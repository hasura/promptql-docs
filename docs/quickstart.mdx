# Quickstart with PromptQL

In this getting started guide, you'll get hands-on with PromptQL by deploying it and connecting to a sample dataset.
You'll use a hosted PostgreSQL database pre-loaded with IMDb movie data. You’ll be able to chat with the data to explore
information about different movies. Then, you'll add custom business logic that lets PromptQL take action — like renting
a movie on a user's behalf.
