# Quickstart with PromptQL

## Introduction

This guide is designed to give you a high-level overview of PromptQL and how you can use it to make better decisions
about your business and automate tasks; all without any coding knowledge required.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, you'll need a [Hasura Cloud account](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/new_user).

If you have your own project, you can apply the information below to it. Otherwise, we have a
[collection of sandboxes](/index.mdx#demos) which allow you to try PromptQL and get a feel for the experience. Below,
we'll use the `sandbox-gtm` example.

If you're looking to build a new project from scratch, check out [these guides](/how-to-build-with-promptql/index.mdx).

:::

## Guide

### Open your project

Each PromptQL project can be accessed via a unique URL. You can access all your projects
[from the PromptQL Console](https://promptql.console.hasura.io/).

/>

When you navigate to a project, you're dropped into its **playground**; this is the chat interface that allows you to
ask questions about your data and create automations.

### Talk to your data

Primarily, you'll interact with PromptQL in one of two ways: either by asking questions, or creating automations.

#### Ask a complex question

Using the `sandbox-gtm` project, we're going to ask the following question:

> _Which enterprise deals are at risk of slipping this quarter based on engagement patterns?_

While this question seems simple, it's complex because it requires defining what qualifies as an enterprise deal,
identifying signals that indicate a deal is at risk—such as low engagement or delayed progress—and analyzing various
engagement patterns, including sales activities, buyer signals, and product usage, all in comparison to historical and
successful deal benchmarks.

If you're using your own project, start by asking a similarly strategic question relevant to your data. Otherwise,

be dropped into a thread replay.

##### Query plan

When you ask a question, PromptQL will respond with a **query plan**. This is a step-by-step breakdown in plain language
of how it will process your request, including any data retrieval, filtering, or AI operations it will perform.

<Thumbnail

  alt="A query plan for a question detailing all steps to find the right data."
  width="1000px"
/>

It helps make PromptQL's approach transparent by explaining what it's going to do before it does it, including any
assumptions it's making about the data or process.

Take a look at the query plan generated for your question and see how PromptQL takes a complex question and breaks it
down into a series of steps, just like a human would.

:::tip Query plans are modifiable

You can edit a query plan by clicking the pencil next to a query plan.

You have domain-specific expertise which you can share with PromptQL. When you modify a query plan, PromptQL remembers
and self-corrects for future threads!

:::

##### Execution

The query plan is then **executed** against your data.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/pql-execution.png" alt="A query plan's execution of Python and SQL." width="1000px" />

PromptQL pulls the necessary data and uses AI to help make sense of it. Behind the scenes, it fetches information from
your database and organizes it using Python, so you can focus on the insights, not the code.

If you're curious, expand the execution in your project and see the code PromptQL is executing against your datasource.
And, just like the query plan, if you see something that should be different, let PromptQL know!

##### Artifacts

Typically, the execution of a query plan will result in an **artifact**.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/get-started/pql-artifact.png"
  alt="A table artifact produced via the execution of a query plan."
  width="1000px"
/>

Artifacts are structured outputs like tables, text, or visualizations that store the processed data or analysis results,
which can be referenced later in the conversation, exported, or used to start new threads for further analysis.

##### Reliability Score

Each response from your agent is assigned a reliability score. This score is based on a number of factors, including the
complexity of the query, the accuracy of the data, and the confidence of your AI model.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/promptql-playground/reliability-score-good.png"
  alt="A strong reliability score with rhetoric."
  width="1000px"
/>

PromptQL will signal its confidence to you and provide reasoning behind the score; if your agent is _not_ confident in
the response, **you can teach it** so that it better understands your business context, terminology, and processes. Your
agent will then remember your feedback and self-correct for future threads!

:::tip This is a conversation!

Talking with PromptQL is like talking to a human. This means it's an iterative process wherein you ask a question, it
responds, and you build on that response by refining, clarifying, or asking follow-up questions. The more context you
provide, the better the answers become.

:::

#### Give it a task to automate

Using the same sandbox project, we'll ask PromptQL to generate an automation for us:

> I need an automation to help me identify risky opportunities in my sales pipeline. I want to input a date range and
> get back a list of opportunities that need attention. Specifically, I want to know which deals:
>
> - Haven't had any recent activity
> - Are missing important contact relationships
> - Show low engagement from the customer
> - Are taking longer than expected to close
>
> Can you create something that gives me a risk score for each opportunity and suggests specific actions I should take?
> I'd like the results in a format that makes it easy for me to prioritize which deals need immediate attention.

This task-based prompt asks PromptQL to build an **automation**: a reusable workflow that runs against your data and
gives you consistent, structured results. Rather than just answering a one-time question, automations are designed to
help you monitor, score, or act on key insights regularly.

<Thumbnail

  alt="A PromptQL-generated automation."
  width="1000px"
/>

In this example, PromptQL will identify the relevant data, define what makes a deal “risky,” build a scoring system to
prioritize those deals, and suggest actions—all packaged in a format that’s easy to review and reuse. Just like with
query plans, PromptQL explains each step and lets you modify the logic, so you stay in control of the process.

If you're using your own project, give PromptQL a similar task to automate. Otherwise,
[click here](https://promptql.console.hasura.io/share/88a988ff-b44b-42b8-9859-846fa4be3f9c?autoReplay=1&speed=fast) to
be dropped into a thread replay.

We also have a dedicated guide to building your own automations available [here](/automation.mdx).

## Next steps

Now that you've had your first set of conversations with PromptQL, we recommend checking out these docs around its
[core capabilities](/capabilities.mdx).
