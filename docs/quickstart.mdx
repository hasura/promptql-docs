# Quickstart with PromptQL

This guide is designed to give you a high-level overview of PromptQL and how you can use it to make better decisions
about your business and automate tasksâ€”all without any coding knowledge required.

:::info Prerequisites

Before continuing, you'll need a [Hasura Cloud account](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/new_user).

If you have your own project, you can apply the information below to it. Otherwise, we have a
[collection of sandboxes](/index.mdx#demos) which allow you to try PromptQL and get a feel for the experience.

:::

## Open your project

Each PromptQL project can be accessed via a unique URL. You can access all your projects
[from the PromptQL Console](https://promptql.console.hasura.io/).

When you navigate to a project, you're dropped into its **playground**; this is the chat interface that allows you to
ask questions about your data and create automations.

## Talk to your data

Primarily, you'll interact with PromptQL in one of two ways: either by asking questions, or creating automations.

### Ask a complex question

Using [the `sandbox-gtm` project](https://promptql.console.hasura.io/public/sandbox-gtm/playground), we're going to ask
the following question:

```plaintext
Which enterprise deals are at risk of slipping this quarter based on engagement patterns?
```

If you're using your own project, ask a question. Otherwise, [click here](#) to be dropped into the playground directly
with the question pre-loaded!

<details>
  <summary>
    Why is this complex?
  </summary>

This is complex because it requires:

1. Defining "enterprise deals" - Could be based on:

   - Account tier/type
   - Deal size
   - Number of users/usage metrics
   - Industry/vertical

2. Determining "risk of slipping" by analyzing:

   - Sales engagement (calls, tasks, events)
   - Buyer engagement signals (6sense scores, successful touches)
   - Deal velocity compared to similar won deals
   - Current stage vs time left in quarter
   - Historical patterns of similar deals that slipped

3. Understanding "engagement patterns" through:

   - Call transcripts and topics discussed
   - Email sequence responses
   - Product usage metrics
   - Multiple stakeholder involvement
   - Comparison to successful deal patterns

</details>

#### Query plan

PromptQL will respond with a **query plan**. This is a step-by-step breakdown in plain language of how it will process
your request, including any data retrieval, filtering, or AI operations it will perform.

It helps make PromptQL's approach transparent by explaining what it's going to do before it does it, including any
assumptions it's making about the data or process.

:::tip Query plans are modifiable

You can edit a query plan by clicking the pencil next to a query plan.

You have domain-specific expertise which you can share with PromptQL. When you modify a query plan, PromptQL remembers
and self-corrects for future threads!

:::

#### Execution

The query plan is then **executed** against your data.

<Thumbnail src="/img/get-started/pql-execution.png" alt="A query plan's execution of Python and SQL." width="1000px" />

PromptQL writes Python code that includes SQL queries to retrieve data, and then processes that data using Python's data
structures and the AI functions provided to it.

#### Artifacts

Typically, the execution of a query plan will result in an **artifact**.

<Thumbnail

  alt="A table artifact produced via the execution of a query plan."
  width="1000px"
/>

Artifacts are structured outputs like tables, text, or visualizations that store the processed data or analysis results,
which can be referenced later in the conversation, exported, or used to start new threads for further analysis.

:::tip This is a conversation!

Talking with PromptQL is like talking to a human. This means it's an iterative process wherein you ask a question, it
responds, and you build on that response by refining, clarifying, or asking follow-up questions. The more context you
provide, the better the answers become.

### Give it a task to automate

TODO: After conversation with Sooraj on Monday, 23 June

- Reusable programs
- Ability to export executable code and run it from an API

## Next steps

- Dev mode
