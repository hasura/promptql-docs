# Quickstart with PromptQL

In this getting started guide, youâ€™ll get hands on experience with PromptQL. In a few steps, you can have PromptQL
running locally, connected to a sample dataset.

<Prereqs />

## Build your PromptQL app

### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```sh title="Before you can create a new Hasura DDN project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura Cloud. After you log in, the CLI will
acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura Cloud resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```sh title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project --with-promptql && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your PostgreSQL connector

```sh title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_pg -i
```

From the dropdown, select `hasura/postgres` (you can type to filter the list). Then, enter the following connection URI:

```plaintext
postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app
```

You can press `ENTER` to advance through the remaining prompts.

### Step 4. Introspect the PostgreSQL database

```sh title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your PostgreSQL database:"
ddn connector introspect my_pg
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_pg/configuration.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

### Step 5. Track your tables

Based on our sample database, a SQL schema will be generated. Let's track all the models and relationships to get
started quickly.

```sh title="Run the following command:"
ddn model add my_pg "*"
ddn relationship add my_pg "*"
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find HML files for each table in our sample database. The DDN CLI will use
these Hasura Metadata Language files to represent these tables from PostgreSQL in your API as
[models](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 6. Create a new build

```sh title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 7. Start your local services

```sh title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and PostgreSQL connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

## Act on your data

### Step 1. Open the PromptQL Playground

```sh title="In another terminal, run:"
ddn console --local
```

### Step 2. Ask questions about your dataset

The console is a web app hosted at console.hasura.io that connects to your local PromptQL API and data sources. Your
data is processed in the DDN PromptQL runtime but isn't persisted externally.

Head over to the console and ask a few questions about your data.

```plaintext title="For example:"
Hi, what are some questions you can answer?
```

PromptQL will respond with information about the dataset and make suggestions for your first query on the data!
