# Quickstart with PromptQL

In this getting started guide, you'll deploy PromptQL and connect it to a sample dataset — a hosted PostgreSQL database
pre-loaded with IMDb movie data. You'll start by exploring the dataset through natural language queries, discovering how
PromptQL can reliably answer questions and assist in decision-making. Then, you'll add custom business logic that lets
PromptQL act on your behalf — like renting a movie for a user — showing how it can go beyond answering questions to
automating tasks.
