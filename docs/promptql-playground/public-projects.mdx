# Public Projects

there, select the PromptQL section.

### Step 3. Enable and Save

Toggle the switch to enable the Public PromptQL Playground and save your changes.

### Step 4. Get Shareable URL

After enabling, a unique URL will be generated. This URL can be shared with anyone you want to give access to your
PromptQL project.

:::info Authentication

When users access your public PromptQL project via the shared URL, they only need to log in to Hasura. No additional
access granting is required, making it truly public in nature.

## Custom Project README

When a project is set to public mode, project administrators can create a custom README in Markdown format. This README
is visible to all users who access the project's public URL, providing essential context and information.

To add a custom README:

1. Navigate to the "README" section in the Project sidebar
2. Compose or paste your Markdown content
3. Click the Save button to apply changes
4. For enabled public PromptQL projects, a public URL is displayed at the top of the page

The custom README feature allows you to:

- Provide project context and background
- Offer usage instructions or guidelines
- Share relevant documentation or resources
- Highlight key features or functionalities
- Set expectations for your users

By utilizing this feature effectively, you can enhance the user experience and facilitate better understanding of your
public PromptQL project.

:::info Token Usage and Billing

By default, token usage for public projects will be billed from the user's PromptQL credits. Project owners have the option to configure a custom LLM if they prefer to handle the token usage differently.
PromptQL includes promotional credits during the 30-day trial period. After the trial period ends, you'll need to [contact our sales team](https://hasura.io/contact-us) to learn more about pricing options.
