# Artifacts

## Introduction

Artifacts are reusable outputs generated by programs in the Playground. They allow you to reference, inspect, and reuse
results such as text, tables, and visualizations across interactions.

When a program returns a supported output type, PromptQL automatically stores it as an artifact. These artifacts can
then be linked across steps in a thread, reused in new instructions, or exported for use elsewhere.

## Types of artifacts

### TextArtifact

**Type**: `"text"`  
**Data shape**: `string`

Text artifacts store plain text — like summaries, explanations, or generated responses. They're ideal for lightweight
results that don’t require structure or formatting. In the Playground, a short preview is shown to help you quickly
identify the content.

For example, if a program returns a single paragraph explaining a dataset, PromptQL will save that result as a
`TextArtifact`.

### TableArtifact

**Type**: `"table"`  
**Data shape**: `list of objects`, where each object represents a row and keys are column names

Table artifacts are used for structured data. Whether you're returning a list of users, products, or any tabular output,
the system recognizes it and saves it as a `TableArtifact`.

In the Playground, you'll see the number of rows and a small sample preview. This is useful for quickly scanning the
data before diving deeper or using it as input to a follow-up question.

### VisualizationArtifact

**Type**: `"visualization"`  
**Data shape**: an object containing:

- `html`: string of rendered visualization markup
- `visualization_data`: the structured data used to create the visualization

Visualization artifacts are built for more expressive output — like charts, graphs, or custom visuals. When a program
returns a visualization with HTML and data, it’s stored as a `VisualizationArtifact`, enabling rich visual exploration
directly in the Playground.

In the interface, the visualization is rendered from the HTML output, giving you a visual snapshot of your program’s
result.

## Saved artifacts vs chat artifacts

Artifacts in PromptQL exist in two contexts: **chat artifacts** and **saved artifacts**. Understanding the difference helps you work more efficiently across conversations.

### Chat artifacts

Chat artifacts are generated within the current conversation thread. When PromptQL creates a chart, table, or text output during your session, it's automatically stored as a chat artifact. These artifacts are available immediately for reference within the same thread.

For example, if you ask PromptQL to "create a sales chart for Q4," the resulting visualization becomes a chat artifact that you can reference later in the same conversation.

### Saved artifacts

Saved artifacts are chat artifacts that you've explicitly saved for reuse across different conversations. When you save an artifact, it becomes available in any thread within your project, allowing you to build on previous work without switching contexts.

To save an artifact, look for the save icon in the artifact's header. Once saved, you can access it from any new conversation by using mentions (see below).

### When to save artifacts

Consider saving artifacts when:

- You've created a query or visualization you'll use repeatedly
- You want to reference work from a previous conversation
- You're building a library of reusable components for your project
- You need to share specific outputs with team members across different threads

## Artifact visibility

Saved artifacts support two visibility modes that control who can access and reference them:

### Private artifacts

Private artifacts are visible only to you. When you save an artifact as private:

- Only you can see it in the mentions dropdown
- Only you can view, edit, or delete it
- Other project collaborators cannot access or reference it

This is the default visibility mode and is ideal for:

- Work in progress that you're not ready to share
- Personal queries or visualizations
- Sensitive data or experimental work

### Project artifacts

Project artifacts are shared with all project collaborators. When you save an artifact with project visibility:

- All project collaborators can see it in the mentions dropdown
- All collaborators can reference it using `@` mentions in their conversations
- Only you (the owner) can edit or delete it
- A collaborator icon badge indicates the artifact is shared

This visibility mode is useful for:

- Reusable queries that benefit the entire team
- Standard visualizations or reports
- Shared data transformations
- Team knowledge base of common artifacts

### Setting visibility

You can set an artifact's visibility when saving it:

1. Click the save icon on any chat artifact
2. Enter a name and optional description
3. Choose visibility:
   - **Private**: Select the lock icon option
   - **Project**: Select the collaborators icon option
4. Click "Save Artifact"

### Changing visibility

To change an artifact's visibility after saving:

1. Navigate to the saved artifact page
2. Click the "More" button (three dots) in the top-right corner
3. Select either:
   - "Share with project collaborators" (to make it project-visible)
   - "Make it private" (to restrict access to yourself)
4. Confirm the change in the modal

:::info Owner permissions
Only the artifact owner can change visibility settings. Project collaborators with view access cannot modify visibility.

### Visibility in mentions

When using `@` mentions, the artifacts you see depend on visibility:

- **Your private artifacts**: Always visible to you in the mentions dropdown
- **Your project artifacts**: Visible to you and all project collaborators
- **Others' project artifacts**: Visible to you if they're shared with the project
- **Others' private artifacts**: Never visible to you

This ensures that mentions respect artifact permissions and collaborators only see artifacts they have access to.

### Project settings

Project administrators can control artifact sharing at the project level:

- When "Allow Artifact Sharing" is **enabled** (default), users can create both private and project artifacts
- When **disabled**, users can only create private artifacts, and existing project artifacts can be made private but not shared again

## Referencing artifacts with mentions

Mentions allow you to reference artifacts directly in your messages using `@` syntax, similar to mentioning people in Slack or other chat applications. This makes it easy to build on previous work, compare results, or provide context to PromptQL.

### How to use mentions

To insert a mention:

1. Type `@` in the chat input box
2. A dropdown appears showing available artifacts
3. Start typing to search by name (fuzzy search supported)
4. Use arrow keys (↑↓) to navigate the list
5. Press Enter to select, or click on an artifact
6. The mention appears as a colored chip in your message

The dropdown shows two sections:

- **Current Conversation**: Artifacts from the active thread
- **Saved Artifacts**: Artifacts you've saved from any conversation

### Referencing chat artifacts

Chat artifacts from your current conversation appear automatically in the mentions dropdown. This makes it easy to iterate on work within the same session.

**Example:**

```plaintext
User: "Create a sales chart for Q4"
PromptQL: [Generates chart artifact: "Q4 Sales Chart"]

User: "Now create a similar chart for @Q4 Sales Chart but for Q3"
PromptQL: [References previous chart, generates Q3 version]

User: "Compare @Q4 Sales Chart and @Q3 Sales Chart side by side"
PromptQL: [Creates comparison using both artifacts]
```

### Referencing saved artifacts

Saved artifacts appear in the mentions dropdown under the "Saved Artifacts" section. You can search across all your saved artifacts by name, making it easy to reuse work from previous conversations.

**Example:**

```plaintext
[Previous conversation - saved artifact: "Customer Segmentation Query"]

[New conversation]
User: "Apply @Customer Segmentation Query to the new dataset"
PromptQL: [Loads saved query, applies to current context]
```

### Keyboard shortcuts

When the mentions dropdown is open:

- **↑↓ Arrow keys**: Navigate through the list
- **Enter/Tab**: Select the highlighted mention
- **Esc**: Close the dropdown without selecting
- **Continue typing**: Filter results with fuzzy search

## Exporting artifacts

Each artifact contains set of three options for exporting data.

### Copy data

The first allows you to copy the raw data. For text artifacts, this is simply a string of text; for table artifacts,
it's an array of JSON objects; and for visualization artifacts, this is the HTML of the visualization in addition to the
JSON of the underlying and visualized data.

### Download data

The download option is identical to the copy option, but provides a context-appropriate file type (e.g., tables are
represented as CSV files).

### Download artifact definition

The artifact definition option provides a JSON file for each artifact that provides additional information, such as the
identifier, along with the artifact's raw data.

:::tip reuse artifacts across conversations

You can reuse artifacts in multiple ways:

- **Within a conversation**: Use `@` mentions to reference any artifact in the current thread
- **Across conversations**: Save an artifact using the save icon, then reference it with `@` mentions in any new thread
- **Share to a new thread**: Click the share icon in the top-right corner of an artifact to open it in a new conversation
