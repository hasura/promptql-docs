# Autograph

Autograph is a tool that enables users to improve the AI model while interacting with PromptQL. When users encounter
unexpected behavior or have specific requests, they can tag @Autograph and provide feedback directly within the
conversation. Once this feedback is reviewed and implemented, it will be incorporated into the AI model in the next
PromptQL release.

## Examples

##### Ask for help

```
@autograph this is not working. Please help.
```

##### Share business context

```
@autograph our week starts from Monday, not Sunday.
```

##### Request to use the right data

```
@autograph always use the "users" table, not "customers".
```

## Walkthrough

1. Find a chat where you want to provide feedback or ask for help.
2. Add a new message and tag @autograph.

3. Once you use @autograph, your request is submitted and visible on the Autograph page.

4. You can check the status of the request in the autograph page. Request status is also visible on the original chat's
   messages (autograph message will contain the request status and reviewer notes, as shown in step 2).
