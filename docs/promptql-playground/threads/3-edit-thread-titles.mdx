# Editing Thread Titles

## Introduction

The PromptQL Playground allows you to customize your thread titles for better organization and clarity. This feature
helps you rename threads to better reflect their content or purpose and quickly identify specific threads when
revisiting them later.

## Accessing the Edit Title Feature

You can edit a thread title directly from the thread history sidebar. Look for the edit icon (pencil) next to the thread
title.

## Editing a Thread Title

When you click the edit icon, a dialog box will appear allowing you to modify the thread title:

1. Enter your new title in the text field
2. Click "Save" to apply the changes
3. Click the "X" symbol in the top right corner to close the dialog without saving
