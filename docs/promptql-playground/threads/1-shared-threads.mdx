# Shared Threads

## Introduction

You can extend the functionality of the Public PromptQL Playground and share a thread publicly.

- You can share specific chat threads with anyone — quickly and effortlessly.
- Users can view a shared thread without logging in.
- Your shared thread is accessible via a public link, with no sign-up or login required for viewers. Allowing you to
  share your insights with the world, whether it's an interesting conversation or an impressive query result with
  artifacts.

## Share

To share a thread publicly, simply click the `Share` button in the thread.

Sharing a thread doesn't reveal any identifiable information about your project. Only the content of the thread itself
is visible. Plus, any messages added after sharing won't appear in the public link, keeping the snapshot of your
conversation intact.
