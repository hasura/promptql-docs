# Shared Threads

## Introduction

You can share a thread from the PromptQL Playground. Threads can be shared in two modes: secure mode (recommended) and
public mode (not recommended). Sharing a thread doesn't reveal any identifiable information about your project.

- Only the current thread and its memory artifacts will be shared
- Your name and project details remain private
- Any messages added after sharing will not be visible in the shared link
- Anyone with the link will be able to access this thread through a publicly accessible URL; if shared in secure mode, a
  password will be required.

:::info Protect your thread

It's recommended to use secure mode with a password **and expiration date** to protect your thread.

## Secure sharing (recommended)

Secure sharing is the recommended way to share threads. In this mode, the thread is accessible only with a password. The
password is auto-generated and can be copied from the share dialog. You can optionally give a password expiry time,
beyond which the thread will no longer be accessible.

### Step 1. Share the thread

First click the `Share` button in the thread.

### Step 3. Select password expiry

You can optionally select a password expiry date. The default is no-expiry. You can see the following options in the
dialog:

- Never (don't expire password, **not recommended**)
- 1 Day
- 1 Week
- Custom

Custom expiry let's you choose the date when the password will expire.

### Step 4. Copy the password

Once you click on `Create Link` button, your thread will be shared securely. You will see another dialog to copy the
thread link and the password. **Note**: Copy and keep the password safe as you won't be able to see it again.

### Step 5. Access the shared thread

Users can access the thread by going to the autogenerated link. They will be prompted to enter the password.

Once the correct password is entered by the user, they will be able to view the thread.

## Public sharing

Public sharing is not recommended as it doesn't have any password protection. Any one with the link can access the
thread.

### Step 1. Share the thread

First click the `Share` button in the thread.
