# Chats

Chats are the conversations you have with your data. They are the backbone of the PromptQL Playground and are how you
interact with your data.

In this section, you'll find tutorials that walk you through some common use cases and best practices for using chats.
Initially, we recommend checking out common use cases:

- [Share a chat](/promptql-playground/chats/shared-chats.mdx)
- [Chat titles](/promptql-playground/chats/chat-titles.mdx)
- [Pin a chat](/promptql-playground/chats/pin-chat.mdx)
- [Delete a chat](/promptql-playground/chats/delete-chat.mdx)

For admin features like playground chat history, see the [Observability section](/observability/chat-history).
