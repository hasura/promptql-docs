# Delete Chat

## Introduction

You can permanently delete chats from your PromptQL Playground when they're no longer needed. This action removes the
entire conversation history and cannot be undone, so use this feature carefully.

## Delete a chat

To delete a chat:

1. **Locate the chat** you want to delete in the chat history sidebar
2. **Click the delete** icon next to the chat title

4. **Confirm the deletion** in the dialog that appears

### Confirmation dialog

When you select delete, a confirmation dialog will appear:

This gives you a final chance to reconsider before permanently removing the chat.

## What happens when you delete

- **Chat is permanently removed** from your history
- **All conversation data is deleted** and cannot be recovered

:::warning Permanent action

Deleting a chat is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you no longer need the conversation before confirming the
deletion.
