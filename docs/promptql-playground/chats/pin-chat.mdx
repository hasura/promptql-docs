# Pin Chat

## Introduction

Pinning chats allows you to keep important conversations at the top of your chat list for easy access. Pinned chats
remain visible and organized separately from your regular chat history, making it simple to return to frequently
referenced conversations or important analyses.

## Pin a chat

To pin a chat, access the chat options menu by clicking the three-dot menu icon next to any chat in your sidebar:

1. **Locate the chat** you want to pin in the chat history sidebar
2. **Click the pin chat** icon next to the chat title

The chat will immediately move to the pinned section at the top of your chat list and display a pin icon.

## Unpin a chat

To unpin a chat, follow the same process:

1. **Click the unpin chat** icon next to the pinned chat
2. **Select "Unpin"** from the dropdown menu

The chat will move back to your regular chat history in chronological order.
