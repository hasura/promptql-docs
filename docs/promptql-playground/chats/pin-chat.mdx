# Pin Thread

## Introduction

Pinning threads allows you to keep important conversations at the top of your thread list for easy access. Pinned threads remain visible and organized separately from your regular thread history, making it simple to return to frequently referenced conversations or important analyses.

## Pin a thread

To pin a thread, access the thread options menu by clicking the three-dot menu icon next to any thread in your sidebar:

1. **Locate the thread** you want to pin in the thread history sidebar
2. **Click the pin thread** icon next to the thread title

The thread will immediately move to the pinned section at the top of your thread list and display a pin icon.

## Unpin a thread

To unpin a thread, follow the same process:

1. **Click the unpin thread** icon next to the pinned thread
2. **Select "Unpin"** from the dropdown menu

The thread will move back to your regular thread history in chronological order.
