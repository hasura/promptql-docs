# Shared Chats

## Introduction

You can share a chat from the PromptQL Playground. Chats can be shared in two modes: secure mode (recommended) and
public mode (not recommended). Sharing a chat doesn't reveal any identifiable information about your project.

- Only the current chat and its memory artifacts will be shared
- Your name and project details remain private
- Any messages added after sharing will not be visible in the shared link
- Anyone with the link will be able to access this chat through a publicly accessible URL; if shared in secure mode, a
  password will be required.

:::info Protect your chat

It's recommended to use secure mode with a password **and expiration date** to protect your chat.

:::danger Data residency concerns

Sharing a chat copies the conversation history and memory artifacts from your data plane to the control plane. Do not
share a chat if you do not want data to go outside your data plane.

## Secure sharing (recommended)

Secure sharing is the recommended way to share chats. In this mode, the chat is accessible only with a password. The
password is auto-generated and can be copied from the share dialog. You can optionally give a password expiry time,
beyond which the chat will no longer be accessible.

### Step 1. Share the chat

First click the `Share` button in the chat.

### Step 3. Select password expiry

You can optionally select a password expiry date. The default is no-expiry. You can see the following options in the
dialog:

- Never (don't expire password, **not recommended**)
- 1 Day
- 1 Week
- Custom

Custom expiry let's you choose the date when the password will expire.

### Step 4. Copy the password

Once you click on `Create Link` button, your chat will be shared securely. You will see another dialog to copy the chat
link and the password. **Note**: Copy and keep the password safe as you won't be able to see it again.

### Step 1. Share the chat

First click the `Share` button in the chat.
