# Chat Titles

## Introduction

Chat titles in the PromptQL Playground help you organize and identify your conversations with data. The system provides
both automatic title generation and manual editing capabilities to ensure your chats are properly labeled and easy to
find.

## Titles are automatically generated

When you start a new conversation, the PromptQL Playground automatically generates meaningful titles using large
language models. This happens after the first exchange between you and the assistant, replacing the initial default
title (which is a truncated version of your first message).

### Generation process

The automatic title generation:

1. **Analyzes your conversation context** including:

   - Your initial user message
   - The assistant's response
   - The query plan (execution steps the agent will perform)

2. **Creates concise, descriptive titles** (maximum 7 words) that accurately summarize:

   - The core data request or analysis goal
   - Key entities like datasets, columns, or metrics
   - Primary data operations being performed

3. **Occurs automatically** after the first assistant action in a new chat

## Edit titles

You can manually edit any chat title directly from the chat history sidebar. Look for the edit icon (pencil) next to the
chat title.

When you click the edit icon, a dialog box will appear allowing you to modify the chat title:

1. Enter your new title in the text field
2. Click `Save` to apply the changes

:::info Keep in mind

- **Titles cannot be empty** - you must provide some text
- **Maximum length is 100 characters** - keep titles concise and descriptive
