# PromptQL Playground

## Introduction

The PromptQL Playground is our UI for chatting with your data. This familiar interface allows you to ask questions
directly about your connected datasources and even take action on behalf of users.

You can see an example below:

<PqlChat>
  <User>Hi, what are some questions you can answer?</User>
  <Pql>
    I can help you analyze data from what appears to be an e-commerce system. Here are some types of questions I can answer:

    <ol>
        <li>Product-related:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Find popular products based on orders or reviews</li>
            <li>Analyze product pricing across categories</li>
            <li>Look up product details and descriptions</li>
            <li>Find products from specific manufacturers or countries</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Order and Purchase Analysis:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Track order statuses</li>
            <li>Analyze delivery times</li>
            <li>Look at purchase patterns</li>
            <li>Find abandoned carts</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Customer Behavior:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze customer reviews and ratings</li>
            <li>Look at shopping patterns</li>
            <li>Track cart abandonment</li>
            <li>Study product category preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Business Metrics:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate sales metrics</li>
            <li>Analyze review scores</li>
            <li>Track coupon usage</li>
            <li>Monitor cart completion rates</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    Would you like me to explore any of these areas in particular?

Conversations produce [artifacts](/promptql-playground/artifacts.mdx), which you can export and re-use throughout your
thread. Additionally, the Playground makes it collaborate and share your project with others, whether as collaborators
or publicly.
