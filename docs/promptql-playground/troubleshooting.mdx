# Troubleshooting

## Introduction

Below, you'll find common errors and how to troubleshoot them.

## Error streaming from LLM: Illegal header value b'Bearer

This error happens when the PromptQL playground has not been started with a PromptQL Secret key.

This typically indicates that a DDN project was not initialized with the local project or the project does not have an
associated PromptQL Secret key.

```ddn title="To check if the project was initialized, run this in the project directory:"
ddn context get project
```

### Case 1: Project has not been initialized

If you get the error `Key "project" is not set.`, you need to initialize a DDN project.

```ddn title="Run the following command in the project directory:"
ddn project init
```

Restarting the local services post this should fix the issue.

### Case 2: Project has been initialized but does not have a PromptQL Secret key

If you already have a project initialized, you might need to generate the PromptQL Secret key for the project.

```ddn title="Run the following command in the project directory to generate a PromptQL Secret key:"
ddn auth generate-promptql-secret-key
```

:::info Use the latest version of the CLI

Ensure you're using the latest version of the CLI:

```ddn
ddn update-cli
```

:::

Restarting the local services post this should fix the issue.

## Error streaming from LLM: Client error '403 Forbidden' for url `https://llm.promptql.pro.hasura.io/stream` For more information check: `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403`

This error happens when the PromptQL playground has been started with an invalid PromptQL Secret key.

This typically happens if an existing PromptQL Secret key is deleted or becomes invalid.

```ddn title="Run the following command in the project directory to generate a new PromptQL Secret key:"
ddn auth generate-promptql-secret-key
```

:::info Use the latest version of the CLI

Ensure you're using the latest version of the CLI:

```ddn
ddn update-cli
```

:::

Restarting the local services post this should fix the issue.

## Local PromptQL threads disappear on service restarts

A local file to store the PromptQL Playground state is required to persist threads data. We can create this file and
mount it to the `promptql-playground` service to ensure the threads data stays persisted.

**Step 1. Create an empty file to store the Playground state**

In your project root directory, run:

```bash copy
touch .promptql_playground.db
```

**Step 2. Mount the file to the Playground service**

Update the project `compose.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
...
promptql-playground:
   ...
   volumes:
     ...
     - ./.promptql_playground.db:/app/promptql_playground/promptql_playground.db
   ...
```

**Step 3. Restart the local services**

Restart the local services, e.g. `docker compose down && ddn run docker-start`.
