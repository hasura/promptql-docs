# Iterate on your Data Model

## Introduction

After first creating your semantic metadata layer to use with PromptQL, you'll often need to iterate on your underlying
data models — whether you're adding a new table, refining a command, or evolving your business logic.

This guide explains when and why you need to run `ddn supergraph build local` to ensure your changes are reflected in
your API.

As a general rule:

- **If your metadata changes** (like models, commands, or relationships): ✅ rebuild.
- **If your connector signature changes** (like a function’s arguments or return type): ✅ rebuild.
- **If you're only changing implementation logic** inside a lambda connector (like editing function body): ❌ no rebuild
  required.

## When to rebuild your application

### You add a new source

Each time you [add a new data source](/data-sources/connect-to-a-source.mdx), you're generating new metadata. This is a
good rule of thumb: **when metadata changes, a rebuild is required.**

After following the steps in the doc referenced above, introspect your source and add your metadata objects before
rebuilding.

### You edit metadata

Whether your metadata changes are generated via the CLI or you've hand-authored a change (using the
[VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura)), you'll need to create a new
build of your application. This will ensure the JSON configuration files consumed by the distributed query engine are
updated with the latest changes.

### You make changes to your underlying data model

Depending on your data source, you may be adding a column to a table in PostgreSQL, or a creating a new collection in
MongoDB. You may have written new custom logic in TypeScript or want to import a new command from the Stripe connector.
Whatever it is, you will follow the same steps each time anything changes in your data source schema to iterate on your
data model.

#### Re-introspect your data model

Re-introspecting your data model will update the connector configuration to reflect the changes in your data sources.

```ddn
ddn connector introspect my_connector
```

#### View resources

```ddn title="You can then view the resources that have been discovered by running:"
ddn connector show-resources my_connector
```

#### Add resources

```ddn title="And add precisely the resources you need running any of the following commands with real values:"
ddn model add my_connector my_model
ddn command add my_connector my_command
ddn relationship add my_connector my_relationship
```

```ddn title="Or if you want to add all resources:"
ddn model add my_connector "*"
ddn command add my_connector "*"
ddn relationship add my_connector "*"
```

#### Add semantic Information

It's highly recommended to provide extra natural language descriptions of the resources in your project so that the
PromptQL can better understand your data and create appropriate query plans.

The description field can be added to `Model`, `Command` and `Relationship` metadata objects to provide semantic
context.

#### Rebuild

```ddn title="You can then create a new build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

:::info Build for Hasura Cloud

You can also create a new build on Hasura Cloud:

If you don't have a project on Hasura Cloud, you can create one by running:

```ddn
ddn project init
```

Then:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build create
```

:::

#### Restart services locally

If you are iterating locally, you then need to restart the Docker services by running:

```ddn
ddn run docker-start
```

:::info When is rebuilding not necessary?

In short: any time you make modifications that don't require metadata updates. Notably, if you're quickly iterating on
the logic of lambda connectors, you can [enable Compose Watch](/business-logic/dev-mode.mdx) to reflect your changes
instantly and rebuild your lambda connector's container.
