# System Instructions

## Introduction

Custom system instructions provide flexibility to fine-tune your PromptQL experience. This configuration allows you to
tailor the application's behavior to your specific needs. These instructions act as a guide for PromptQL, shaping how it
interprets questions and crafts responses.

:::warning System Instructions shape behavior

As outlined below, system instructions shape the _behavior_ of a PromptQL application.

However, through connecting data sources and writing your own custom business logic, you're actively providing new tools
which PromptQL can use. While context in the form of system instructions is helpful, you can explain with greater
detail—and with much tighter scope—what each tools does using metadata descriptions.

Learn more about the available metadata objects [here](/metadata/index.mdx).

## How to write system instructions

### Example

Consider this example where we set the system instructions for a GTM-focused PromptQL application.

```yaml title="globals/metadata/promptql-config.hml"
kind: PromptQlConfig
version: v2
definition:
  llm:
    provider: hasura
    systemInstructions: |

      You are an AI assistant that helps go-to-market teams make data-driven decisions.

      You have access to:
      - Salesforce (opportunities, accounts, leads)
      - Clari (forecast categories, pipeline movement)
      - Postgres (custom product and revenue data)

      Use this data to answer questions about:
      - Sales performance (e.g. win rate, top reps)
      - Forecast accuracy (e.g. projected vs actual)
      - Pipeline health (e.g. stalled deals, pipeline coverage)
      - Rep activity (e.g. activity count, call volume)
      - Account trends (e.g. expansion opportunities, churn risk)

      When inserting new sales records, use the function:
      insert_revenue(product_id UUID, amount numeric, period text)

      Example usage:
      insert_revenue('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 4500.00, '2024-Q4')

      Prioritize clarity, brevity, and business relevance in your answers.

      If the question is ambiguous or missing key context (e.g. time range, owner name, stage), ask for clarification before proceeding.

      Do not speculate. Stick to facts available in the data.

      Output results in simple, easy-to-read text. Use bullet points, summaries, and key metrics where helpful. Avoid verbose explanations.

      If referencing a table, column, or enum, use *snake_case* and SQL naming conventions.
```

This example demonstrates how to guide PromptQL effectively using best practices. It avoids unnecessary verbosity,
focuses on what matters, and sets the right expectations for the application's behavior.

### Clear scope and purpose

The instruction clearly defines the assistant's role:

- **Audience:** Go-to-market teams
- **Purpose:** Answer questions using real sales and revenue data
- **Data sources:** Salesforce, Clari, and a custom Postgres database

This helps the application stay on track and understand the boundaries of its role.

### Helpful context, not redundancy

Rather than repeating obvious schema facts (e.g., “This column stores city names”), the system instruction provides:

- Common question types (e.g., forecast accuracy, pipeline health)
- Real-world examples of each category
- Situations where the application should ask for clarification

This context improves the quality of the application's outputs and helps it better understand ambiguous queries.

### Global guidance is in the right place

Important global behaviors are captured here instead of scattered across metadata:

- Stick to **facts**—don’t speculate
- Ask for clarification if details are missing
- Use **snake_case** and SQL naming conventions
- Prioritize **clarity and brevity** in outputs

System instructions are the best place to capture these global rules.

### Structured, prescriptive, and precise

The instructions are written in a simple, structured format:

- Bulleted lists for data sources and use cases
- Clear formatting expectations; markdown is acceptable
- No filler or LLM-generated fluff

This makes the guidance both human-readable and model-optimized.

### Guidelines

When writing system instructions, your goal is to **narrow PromptQL's focus** and **reduce ambiguity**. Here are some
guidelines.

- **Be clear and concise:** PromptQL performs better when instructions are direct and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Define the role and audience:** Tell the agent who it is (e.g., a sales analyst, a support bot) and who it is
  helping.
- **Specify sources of knowledge:** Mention any data sources, systems, or domains PromptQL should rely on when
  answering.
- **Encourage appropriate behavior:** Highlight priorities like brevity, clarity, formality, creativity, or
  error-handling.
- **Provide code patterns or examples:** You can include sample Python functions, formulas, or logic patterns to guide
  how PromptQL generates its own code. These are not backend functions to call, but templates for the LLM to adapt and
  build from.
- **Include example SQL functions:** If you're exposing functions via metadata, describe how to call them. Include
  argument names, data types, and a sample use case. For example:

  > Use the `insert_revenue(product_id: UUID, amount: numeric, period: text)` function when answering questions
  > involving new sales data. This records revenue per product for a specific period.

- **Anticipate ambiguity:** If the application might face unclear inputs, instruct it on when and how to ask for
  clarification.
- **Set limits if needed:** If certain topics, behaviors, or types of output should be avoided, explicitly mention them.
- **Test and iterate:** Start simple, evaluate outputs, and refine your instructions based on observed behavior.
