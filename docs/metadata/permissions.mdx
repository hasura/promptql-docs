# Protect Data

## Introduction

**Permissions** keep data secure by allowing you to control what data can be accessed through PromptQL conversations by
which user roles. This ensures that when users talk to their data using PromptQL, they only see the information they're
authorized to access.

When an authentication mode is enabled, the distributed query engine will look for session variables on every PromptQL
request, it can then use permissions defined in metadata and the session variables to determine if the request is
allowed to proceed.

## Lifecycle

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) rules in your metadata are used to determine which user roles can access which data
when interacting with PromptQL.

The CLI will automatically create permissions for your models and commands when they are added to your metadata for only
the `admin` role by default.

All other permissions for all other user roles must be added manually.

## Create a permission

### Row access

You can create a `ModelPermission` object to implement row-level security and restrict which rows a user can access
through PromptQL.

```yaml title="For example, to only allow users to access their own records in the Users table when talking to their data through PromptQL:"
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Users
  permissions:
    # admin is present by default
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      select:
        filter:
          fieldComparison:
            field: id
            operator: _eq
            value:
              sessionVariable: x-hasura-user-id
    #highlight-end
```

The highlighted role above will filter data accessed through PromptQL to only show `Users` records whose `id` matches
the `x-hasura-user-id` passed in the header of the request.

### Field access

To restrict which fields can be accessed through PromptQL conversations, you can create a `TypePermission` object.

Below, the user role can only access the `name` field, not the `id` field which the admin role can.

```yaml title="The user role can only access their name field:"
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Users
  permissions:
    # admin is present by default
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - id
          - name
    #highlight-start
    - role: user
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - name
    #highlight-end
```

### Command (mutation) access

To determine which commands can be executed by which roles when interacting with PromptQL, you can create a
`CommandPermission` object.

```yaml title="In this example, we'll make it so a user can update their own record:"
kind: CommandPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  commandName: UpdateUsersById # Specify the existing command
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      allowExecution: true
      #highlight-start
    - role: user
      allowExecution: true
      argumentPresets: # Specify the arguments and their values which need to be passed to the command
        - argument: keyId
          value:
            sessionVariable: "x-hasura-user-id" # The value of the argument must equal the session variable
      #highlight-end
```

When a user asks PromptQL to update their information, these permissions ensure that they can only modify their own
records.

## Update a permission

Since all permissions are stored in metadata, you can use your text editor to find and update them easily.

For example, to check everything which the `user` role can access when talking to data through PromptQL, search for
`- role: user` and analyze the results.

## Delete a permission

If you no longer need a role, find all mentions of it in your metadata and remove them all.

If you no longer need a particular permission, simply remove it from the relevant `ModelPermissions`, `TypePermissions`,
or `CommandPermissions` object.
