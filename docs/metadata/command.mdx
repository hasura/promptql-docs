# Write Data

## Introduction

In PromptQL, **commands** let you call custom functions or procedures from your data sources, usually to mutate data.

While commands _can_ handle reads, youâ€™ll mostly reach for them when you need to perform write operations on your data
source _or_ when executing custom business logic. You decide whether they're exposed as queries or mutations for
PromptQL, based on how you configure them.

```yaml title="An example command for inserting a user:"
kind: Command
version: v1
definition:
  name: create_user
  description: |
    Creates a new user in the system. This command is typically used when someone registers
    for the app or is added manually by an admin. It captures core details like:
    - name
    - email
    This is often the first step before establishing relationships with sessions,
    subscriptions, or other user-linked resources.
  outputType: action_response!
  arguments:
    - name: name
      type: String!
    - name: email
      type: String!
  source:
    dataConnectorName: operations
    dataConnectorCommand:
      procedure: create_user
```

## Lifecycle

### Create a command

To add a command you will need to have a data connector which has already introspected the data source. Follow the
relevant tutorial in [How to Build with PromptQL](/how-to-build-with-promptql/index.mdx) to get to that point.

```ddn title="Add your command by passing the connector's and command's names:"
# Alternatively, you can add all commands: ddn command add <connector_link_name> "*"

ddn command add <connector_link_name> <command_name>
```

:::tip Not sure which commands you have?

You can see a list of all available resources using the CLI:

```ddn
ddn connector show-resources <connector_name>
```

:::

For each command, you'll find an HML file included in the relevant `metadata` directory for your connected data source.

**Typically, a particular model will have corresponding commands for inserts, updates, and deletes.** This gives
PromptQL the power to act as a write layer for your API, letting you execute domain-specific operations directly against
your connected data sources.

You can now [create a build](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build.mdx), serve it, and begin manipulating the
data underlying the command through PromptQL.

### Update a command

When your underlying data source changes, you'll need to update the commands available to PromptQL to ensure continued
accuracy in its operations:

```ddn title="Re-introspect your data source:"
ddn connector introspect <connector_name>
```

```ddn title="Then, update your existing command:"
ddn command update <connector_link_name> <command_name>
```

You will see an output which explains how new resources were added or updated in the command.

You can now [create a build](/reference/cli/commands/ddn_supergraph_build.mdx), serve it, and continue interacting with
the data it represents using PromptQL, which will automatically adjust its query plans based on the updated command
definitions.

:::tip You can manually edit metadata!

You can also update the command by manually editing the metadata. To avoid errors, we recommend using the
[VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura) to validate your changes.

:::

### Delete a command

```ddn title="If you no longer need a command, you can delete it:"
ddn command remove <command_name>
```

Along with the command itself, the associated metadata is also removed, and PromptQL will no longer include this command
in its query planning.

## Next steps

- If you've added your first command, check out [relationships for connecting data](/metadata/relationship.mdx) next.
- Business logic is exposed as commands written in TypeScript, Go, or Python. Learn more about adding this functionality
  by [connecting a lambda connector](/business-logic/index.mdx).
- You can learn more about commands in the metadata reference [docs](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx).
