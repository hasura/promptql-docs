# Get Started with Hasura DDN and an Existing GraphQL API

<Prereqs />

## Tutorial

<BoilerplateInit />

Select `hasura/graphql` (you can type to filter the list). Then, enter the following environment variables:

| ENV                | Example                                     | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` | `https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/` | The GraphQL endpoint for the existing API. |

:::info The GraphQL connector is highly configurable

When you first initialize the connector, the CLI will only ask for the API's endpoint. You can further configure the
connector — such as choosing different configurations for introspection vs. execution — using the connector's
configuration file.
