# With API Endpoints

:::info Project Creation Requirements

To create a project, you'll need both a [Hasura Cloud account](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup) and have been granted
permission to create projects via our AI Catalyst Team. If you haven't been in touch, you can reach out
[here](https://promptql.io/book-demo) to get help.

:::

We can connect PromptQL to API endpoints to query them directly.

Sometimes bulk loading data from API services might be overkill. In such cases, connecting to API endpoints directly is
useful or a convenient way to test your API integration.

However, if you expect to run into API rate limits, or need more flexible access to data that would require filtering
data in ways that the API doesn't natively allow for, consider
[bulk loading the data instead](/how-to-build-with-promptql/with-apis-with-bulk-data.mdx).

## Tutorial

Instead of adding a connector that is backed by a persistent data store (like a database, or DuckDB), we'll add a
**lambda** connector.

After creating your supergraph project with:

```ddn
ddn supergraph init myproject --with-promptql
```

Load one of the following connectors:

1. TypeScript + DuckDB: `hasura/duckduckapi`
2. TypeScript with NodeJS runtime: `hasura/nodejs`
3. Python: `hasura/python`

All of these connectors follow the same design, but for the purposes of this guide we'll follow the TypeScript guide.

### Step 1. Initialize the connector

**Install the connector and say hello!**

```ddn
ddn connector init typescript -i
```

### Step 2. Introspect the connector

```ddn
ddn connector introspect typescript
ddn commands list typescript
```

You should see a default `hello` command being `AVAILABLE` which means that itâ€™s not yet added to the supergraph.

### Step 3. Call an external API

Open the `app/connector/typescript/functions.ts` file.

```ts title="Replace the contents with the following:"
/**
 * This is an API to say hello from httpbin for a given name
 * @readonly
 */
export async function helloFromHttpBin(name?: string): Promise<{ greeting?: string }> {
  const greeting = { greeting: name };

  const response = await fetch("https://httpbin.org/post", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ greeting: `Hello ${name}!` }),
  });

  const data: any = await response.json();
  return { greeting: data?.json?.greeting };
}
```

### Step 4. Add the metadata

```ddn
ddn connector introspect typescript
ddn commands list typescript
ddn commands add typescript helloFromHttpBin
```

### Step 5. Create and run a new build

```ddn title="Create a new local build:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```ddn title="Run your services:"
ddn run docker-start
```

```ddn title="In a new terminal tab, open the devlopment console:"
ddn console --local
```

Head over to the PromptQL Playground and see if the AI assistant is able to call your API integration.

```plaintext
say hello from httpBin for everyone
```
