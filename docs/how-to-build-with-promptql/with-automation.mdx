# Building Automation with PromptQL

## Introduction

PromptQL automation allows you to transform one-time conversations into reliable, repeatable business processes. Once you've built and tested a workflow in the PromptQL Playground, you can deploy it as an API endpoint that can be called programmatically or integrated into your existing systems.

Perfect for scenarios like generating reports, analyzing data, classifying content, or any repetitive task that benefits from AI-powered insights.

## Getting Started with Automation

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Ensure you have a PromptQL project with your data sources connected and properly configured. Your project should be in a working state where you can successfully query your data through the playground.

### Step 2: Create Your First Automation

1. **Start a new chat thread** with your newly created build
2. **Ask a question and iterate** until you arrive at a reliable, repeatable process
3. **Describe what you want to automate** - be specific about your input and expected output format
4. **Ask to create an automation** for that specific task

#### Example Prompts to Try:

```
"Build an automation to generate monthly sales reports from our database"
```

```
"Create an automation that analyzes customer feedback sentiment and categorizes responses"
```

```
"Make an automation that classifies support tickets by priority level based on content"
```

5. **Review the generated logic** - PromptQL creates and tests the automation logic automatically
6. **Test with sample data** to ensure the automation works as expected
7. **Click the deploy button** when you're satisfied with the results
8. **Get your API endpoint** - you'll receive usage instructions and the HTTP API URL

## Automation Use Cases

### Sales Reporting Automation
**Use Case:** Generate standardized monthly sales reports
- **Input:** Date range, region filters
- **Output:** Formatted report with key metrics, trends, and insights
- **Benefits:** Consistent reporting format, automated insights, time savings

### Customer Feedback Analysis
**Use Case:** Analyze and categorize customer feedback at scale
- **Input:** Customer feedback text, survey responses
- **Output:** Sentiment scores, category classifications, action recommendations
- **Benefits:** Real-time insights, consistent analysis, scalable processing

### Support Ticket Classification
**Use Case:** Automatically prioritize and route support tickets
- **Input:** Ticket content, customer information
- **Output:** Priority level, department routing, suggested responses
- **Benefits:** Faster response times, consistent prioritization, improved customer satisfaction

## API Integration

Once deployed, your automation becomes a standard HTTP API endpoint that you can integrate into:

- **Business applications** - Call from your existing software systems
- **Workflow tools** - Integrate with tools like Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate
- **Scheduled jobs** - Set up cron jobs or scheduled tasks to run automations
- **Custom applications** - Build applications that leverage your automated insights

### Sample API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST "https://promptql.ddn.hasura.app/playground/automations/v1/automation/run?project_id=xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "input": "your structured input",
  }'
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start simple** - Begin with a straightforward use case to learn the process
2. **Iterate and improve** - Refine your automation based on initial results
3. **Scale gradually** - Add more complex logic and additional use cases over time
