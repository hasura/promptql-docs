### Step 1. Authenticate your CLI

```ddn title="Before you can create a new PromptQL project, you need to authenticate your CLI:"
ddn auth login
```

This will launch a browser window prompting you to log in or sign up for Hasura DDN, our cloud provider. After you log
in, the CLI will acknowledge your login, giving you access to Hasura DDN resources.

### Step 2. Scaffold out a new local project

```ddn title="Next, create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init my-project --with-promptql && cd my-project
```

Once you move into this directory, you'll see your project scaffolded out for you. You can view the structure by either
running `ls` in your terminal, or by opening the directory in your preferred editor.

### Step 3. Initialize your connector

```ddn title="In your project directory, run:"
ddn connector init my_connector -i
```
