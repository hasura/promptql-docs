# Common Data Source & Logic Patterns

## Introduction

PromptQL, powered by Hasura DDN, makes it simple to build AI-ready APIs on your data — no matter where it lives.

You'll connect your data using **native connectors**, configure your API using **Hasura Metadata Language (HML)**, and
create an immutable **build** that will serve your application.

Then, you'll use the **PromptQL Playground UI** or the **PromptQL API** to chat with your data, ask questions, or
automate tasks — just like you would with a trusted analyst or engineer who speaks your business’ language.

## Let's build something

To get started, it's helpful to look at common patterns for building PromptQL applications based on the datasource(s)
you want to include:

- [With a persistent datasource and custom business logic](/recipes/tutorials/with-a-datasource-and-custom-business-logic.mdx)
- [With API endpoints](/recipes/tutorials/with-api-endpoints.mdx)
- [With bulk API data](/recipes/tutorials/with-apis-with-bulk-data.mdx)

:::info Mix and match

Keep in mind: these are simply broad buckets for you to get started. Any sources we support can be added to the same
project to create a **unified agentic semantic metadata** layer which feeds data to PromptQL.
