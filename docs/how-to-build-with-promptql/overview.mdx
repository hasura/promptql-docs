# Basics

## Introduction

PromptQL is powered by Hasura DDN, which enables a powerful, yet simple-to-create AI-enabled API on your data.

Each tutorial in this section will guide you through creating your PromptQL project on top of your preferred data
source. First, let's go over the broad stokes of how it works.

### You have data

Your data can live in a variety of places - relational or non-relational databases, OLAP or OLTP databases, vector
stores, third-party services, or output by your code. With PromptQL, you can talk to all of it from a single endpoint.

### You connect it to PromptQL

Regardless of where your data lives, you'll connect it to your API using a **native data connector**. These connectors
will introspect your data sources and generate metadata that Hasura DDN will use to build and power your PromptQL
application.

### You configure your API in metadata

This **semantic metadata layer** is written as Hasura Metadata Language (HML), which is an extension of YAML. You can
use the DDN CLI and your text editor to fine-tune and configure the API to your liking; this includes easily creating
metadata objects for permissions, relationships, configuring authentication, etc.

### You talk to your data

To convert your metadata into something that you can talk with, you'll create a build - an immutable snapshot of your
API at that point in time which the Hasura Engine can run and via PromptQL. You can then use the **PiQL** (pronounced
_pickle_) - our GUI - to talk to your data, or integrate it with your client apps via the **PromptQL API**.
