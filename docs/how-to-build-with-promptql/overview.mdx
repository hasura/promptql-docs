# Common Data Source & Logic Patterns

## Introduction

PromptQL, powered by Hasura DDN, makes it simple to build AI-ready APIs on your data â€” no matter where it lives.

You'll connect your data using **native connectors**, configure your API using **Hasura Metadata Language (HML)**, and
create an immutable **build** that will serve your application.

Then, you'll use **PiQL**, our built-in GUI, or the **PromptQL API** to talk to your data.

## Let's build something

To get started, it's helpful to look at common patterns for building PromptQL applications based on the datasource(s)
you want to include:

- [With a persistent datasource and custom business logic](with-a-datasource-and-custom-business-logic.mdx)
- [With API endpoints](with-api-endpoints.mdx)
- [With bulk API data](with-apis-with-bulk-data.mdx)

:::info Mix and match

Keep in mind: these are simply broad buckets for you to get started. Any sources we support can be added to the same
project to create a unified supergraph which feeds data to PromptQL.
