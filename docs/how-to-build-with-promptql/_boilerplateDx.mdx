import { PqlChat, User, Pql, QueryPlanComponent } from "@site/src/components/PqlChat/PqlChat";

### Step 4. Introspect your source

```ddn title="Next, use the CLI to introspect your source:"
ddn connector introspect my_connector
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your source's schema in the
`app/connector/my_connector/configuration||config.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your
editor.

```ddn title="Additionally, you can check which resources are available — and their status — at any point using the CLI:"
ddn connector show-resources my_connector
```

### Step 5. Add your resources

```ddn title="Add your resources to create metadata:"
ddn model add my_connector "*"
ddn command add my_connector "*"
ddn relationship add my_connector "*"
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find newly-generated file(s) ending in `.hml`. The DDN CLI will use these
Hasura Metadata Language files to represent your data source to PromptQL as
[models](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx), [commands](/reference/metadata-reference/commands.mdx), and
[relationships](/reference/metadata-reference/relationships.mdx).

### Step 6. Add semantic information to your metadata (optional)

It is highly recommended to provide extra natural language descriptions of the resources in your project so that the LLM
can better understand your data and create appropriate query plans.

The description field can be added to `Model`, `Command` and `Relationship` metadata objects to provide semantic
context.

### Step 7. Create a new build

```ddn title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

### Step 8. Start your local services

```ddn title="Start your local Hasura DDN Engine and connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

### Step 9. Chat with your data

```ddn title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

Once the PromptQL interface is open, ask a question about your data. For example:

<PqlChat>
  <User>Hi, what are some questions you can answer?</User>
  <Pql>
    I can help you analyze data from what appears to be an e-commerce system. Here are some types of questions I can answer:

    <ol>
        <li>Product-related:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Find popular products based on orders or reviews</li>
            <li>Analyze product pricing across categories</li>
            <li>Look up product details and descriptions</li>
            <li>Find products from specific manufacturers or countries</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Order and Purchase Analysis:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Track order statuses</li>
            <li>Analyze delivery times</li>
            <li>Look at purchase patterns</li>
            <li>Find abandoned carts</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Customer Behavior:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze customer reviews and ratings</li>
            <li>Look at shopping patterns</li>
            <li>Track cart abandonment</li>
            <li>Study product category preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Business Metrics:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate sales metrics</li>
            <li>Analyze review scores</li>
            <li>Track coupon usage</li>
            <li>Monitor cart completion rates</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

### Step 10. Iterate on your source's schema

If something changes in your data source's schema, you can iterate on your data model by following the steps in the
[iteration guide](/metadata/guides/iterate.mdx).
