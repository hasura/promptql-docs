## Next steps

Congratulations on completing your first Hasura PromptQL project with {props.dataSourceName}! ðŸŽ‰

Here's what you just accomplished:

- You started with a fresh project and connected it to {props.dataSourceName}.
- You set up metadata to represent your database schema, which acts as the blueprint for PromptQL.
- Then, you created a build â€” essentially compiling everything into a ready-to-use structure â€” and successfully ran your
  first PromptQL queries to learn about your data.

Now, you're equipped to connect and expose your data, empowering you to iterate and scale with confidence. Great work!

Take a look at our [connector docs](/reference/connectors/index.mdx) to learn more about how to use PromptQL with
{props.dataSourceName}. Or, if you're ready, get started with
[adding custom business logic](/business-logic/overview.mdx) to get PromptQL to act on a user's behalf!
