# AI Primitives

## Introduction

Under the hood, PromptQL utilizes a set of built-in primitives, in conjunction with any
[custom business logic](/business-logic/index.mdx) you've provided, to create small programs on top of your data.

These primitives pair relevant data or artifactsâ€”represented as `inputs` or `data`â€”from your application with on-the-fly
and context-aware `instructions` based on the thread between the user and PromptQL.

The built-in primitives available are:

- [Summarize](/ai-primitives/summarize.mdx)
- [Classify](/ai-primitives/classify.mdx)
- [Extract](/ai-primitives/extract.mdx)
- [Visualize](/ai-primitives/visualize.mdx)

:::info Think of this as a toolbox ðŸ§°

Each primitive is a specialized tool designed to perform a specific task on your data. They're flexible, composable, and
context-aware, letting you build intelligent workflows by combining natural language instructions with structured input.

As you [add your own custom business logic](/business-logic/index.mdx), you're providing more specific tools to PromptQL
that it can compose and use to solve your business problems.
