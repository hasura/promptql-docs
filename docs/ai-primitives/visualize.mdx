# Visualize

## Introduction

The visualize function illustrates PromptQL's ability to transform data into meaningful visual insights without
requiring technical visualization expertise. While you can provide styling preferences, PromptQL automatically
determines the most effective way to represent your data - choosing appropriate chart types, scales, and interactive
features based on the data's structure and the insights you're seeking.

## Example

Here's an example showing how PromptQL creates an interactive visualization of restaurant categories:

```python
viz_result = executor.visualize(
    instructions="""
    Create an interactive bar chart showing the distribution of restaurant categories.
    Requirements:
    - Use a horizontal bar chart for better readability of category names
    - Sort bars by count in descending order
    - Use a pleasant color scheme (preferably blues or teals)
    - Include hover tooltips showing exact count
    - Add a clear title 'Restaurant Categories Distribution'
    - Make the chart responsive to container width
    - Include total number of restaurants in each category
    """,
    data=viz_data
)
```

The instructions focus on the desired outcome rather than technical specifications. PromptQL automatically handles the
complexity of creating responsive, interactive visualizations - managing details like proper data scaling, axis
formatting, and mobile responsiveness while ensuring the resulting visualization effectively communicates your data's
story.
