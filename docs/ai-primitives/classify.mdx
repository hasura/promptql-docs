# Classify

## Introduction

The classify function leverages PromptQL's deep understanding of context to automatically sort content into meaningful
categories. While you can provide category lists and basic guidance, PromptQL intelligently recognizes subtle
distinctions and nuances that determine classification. It understands context-specific signals - like what makes a
restaurant "fine dining" versus "casual," or what distinguishes different cuisine types - without requiring exhaustive
rules or criteria.

## Example

If you ask a question like:

> "Can you help me organize my list of restaurants? I need to know which ones are fancy versus casual, and what kind of
> food they serve.

Here's an example showing how PromptQL handles restaurant classification with minimal instruction:

```python
classifications = executor.classify(
    instructions="""
    Categorize each restaurant based on its name and any available description.
    A restaurant can belong to multiple categories.
    Consider both the dining style (Fine Dining, Casual) and cuisine type.
    Examples:
    - A high-end Italian restaurant would be both "Fine Dining" and "Italian"
    - A casual American pub would be both "Casual Dining" and "American"
    """,
    categories=categories,
    allow_multiple=True,
    inputs=unique_restaurants
)
```

Notice how the instructions provide just basic examples - PromptQL automatically understands the many signals that
indicate dining style (like price points, menu complexity, atmosphere) and cuisine authenticity, making sophisticated
classification decisions without needing detailed criteria for each category.

## Next steps

Classification pairs well with PromptQL's ability to [extract](/ai-primitives/extract.mdx) information and structure it
in a way that makes it easier to draw insights.
