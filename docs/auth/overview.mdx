# Auth

## Introduction

PromptQL is agnostic about how you authenticate users. You can integrate many popular auth services or use your own
custom solution.

After authentication, session variables are passed via either a valid JWT or webhook to the application to be checked
against your access control rules or "permissions" to determine what data the user can access. This ensures any
conversations are scoped to only return information users are permitted to access.

## AuthConfig options

Authentication in PromptQL can be set up in one of three modes. These modes and their configuration options are
specified in the `AuthConfig` object within your metadata.

### JWT mode

Your authentication service must issue JWTs which contain session variables that are passed to PromptQL by the client on
each request.

### Webhook mode

PromptQL will call a webhook on each request with the client headers forwarded. On successful authentication, the
webhook must return a valid `http` response with session variables in the body.

[Read more](/auth/webhook/index.mdx).

### NoAuth mode

No authentication is required for a specific role to access the data.
