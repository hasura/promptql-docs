# Auth

## Introduction

By default, PromptQL accesses your data through the distributed query engine in [NoAuth](/auth/noauth-mode.mdx) mode as
an `admin` user. This means that by default on a new installation, it has full access to your data.

However, you can integrate many popular auth services or use your own custom solution to authenticate users.

After the authentication step, session variables, including a user role, are passed via either a valid JWT or webhook
response, to the query engine to be checked against the access control rules or "permissions" to determine what data the
user can access. This ensures any PromptQL conversations are scoped to only return information that a particular user is
permitted to access.

## AuthConfig options

Authentication can be set up in one of three modes or multiple modes. These modes and their configuration options are
specified in the `AuthConfig` object within your metadata.

You can configure a single authentication mode or multiple authentication modes using the `alternativeModes` field in
`AuthConfig` v4. When using multiple authentication modes, you can specify which mode to use for a particular request by
including the `X-Hasura-Auth-Mode` header with the identifier of the desired authentication mode. [Read more about
multiple auth modes](/auth/multiple-auth-modes.mdx).

### JWT mode

Your authentication service must issue JWTs which contain session variables that are passed to the distributed query
engine by PromptQL on each request.

[Read more](/auth/jwt/index.mdx).

### Webhook mode

PromptQL will call a webhook on each request with the client headers forwarded. On successful authentication, the
webhook must return a valid `http` response with session variables in the body.

[Read more](/auth/webhook/index.mdx).

### NoAuth mode

No authentication is required for a specific role to access the data.
