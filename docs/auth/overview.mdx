# Auth

## Introduction

By default, PromptQL accesses your data through DDN in [NoAuth](/auth/noauth-mode.mdx) mode as an `admin` user. This
means that by default on a new installation, it has full access to your data.

However, you can integrate many popular auth services or use your own custom solution to authenticate users.

After the authentication step, session variables, including a user role, are passed via either a valid JWT or webhook
response, to the DDN engine to be checked against the access control rules or "permissions" to determine what data the
user can access. This ensures any PromptQL conversations are scoped to only return information that a particular user is
permitted to access.

As you will most often be using PromptQL in the console interface, you can check the auth which the client is using by
clicing the "Auth" button on the left of the chat textbox.

Learn how to check the auth which the PromptQL Playground client is using [here](/auth/playground-auth.mdx).

## AuthConfig options

Authentication can be set up in one of three modes. These modes and their configuration options are specified in the
`AuthConfig` object within your metadata.

### JWT mode

Your authentication service must issue JWTs which contain session variables that are passed to the DDN engine by the
PromptQL client on each request.

### Webhook mode

PromptQL will call a webhook on each request with the client headers forwarded. On successful authentication, the
webhook must return a valid `http` response with session variables in the body.

[Read more](/auth/webhook/index.mdx).

### NoAuth mode

No authentication is required for a specific role to access the data.
