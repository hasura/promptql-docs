# NoAuth

## Introduction

NoAuth mode is a simple way to run your application without authentication and is enabled by default. This is useful for
testing or development purposes or to run your project as fully public without any authentication.

:::danger Production Warning

Using NoAuth mode in production environments is not advisable unless you intend for your application to be completely
public. If your connected sources contain any sensitive data, you should enable authentication and avoid using NoAuth
mode in production.

:::

When you create a new project with the `ddn supergraph init` command, noAuth mode is enabled by default.

## Enabling NoAuth Mode

### Step 1. Update your AuthConfig

On default, in a standard new PromptQL project, you'll find an `AuthConfig` file in your `globals` directory already
configured for noAuth mode.

```yaml title="An AuthConfig for noAuth mode:"
kind: AuthConfig
version: v4
definition:
  mode:
    noAuth:
      role: admin
      sessionVariables: {}
```

#### `role`

The role to be assumed while running the application in `noAuth` mode. If you intend for your supergraph to be fully
public, you can set this to a value such as `public` or `anonymous` so that it's explicit.
[Read more about the `Role` value](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-role)

#### `sessionVariables`

Static session variables that will be used while running the application without authentication. This is helpful when
you want to test requests using particular session variables, such as `x-hasura-user-id` with a non-admin role.
[Read more about the `SessionVariables` value](/reference/metadata-reference/auth-config.mdx#authconfig-sessionvariables)

### Step 2. Check permissions

On a default, standard new project you will find permissions such as the below for an example `Posts` model:

```yaml title="TypePermissions:"
kind: TypePermissions
version: v1
definition:
  typeName: Posts
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      output:
        allowedFields:
          - authorId
          - content
          - postId
          - title
```

```yaml title="ModelPermissions:"
kind: ModelPermissions
version: v1
definition:
  modelName: Posts
  permissions:
    - role: admin
      select:
        filter: null
        allowSubscriptions: true
```

You can see that the `admin` role has full access to the `Posts` model with no filtering in the `ModelPermissions` and
all fields being allowed in the `TypePermissions`.

### Step 3. Build your application

```ddn
ddn supergraph build local
```

### Step 4. Make an unauthenticated request

```title="Open the Hasura DDN console and make a request:"
ddn console --local
```

You can query your data without any authentication.
