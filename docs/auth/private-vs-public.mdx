# Private vs Public

You can choose to make your PromptQL application public or private.

## Private

A `private` PromptQL project is only accessible to collaborators on your project.

Requests to a private application must include a special reserved header `x-hasura-ddn-token` with a valid JWT token
which the console generates and regenerates every hour. Currently this token is only available in the console.

If a `private` application is also set to JWT or Webhook mode, rather than `noAuth` mode, queries must **also** include
the JWT or webhook authentication values to be successful in addition to the `x-hasura-ddn-token` header.

## Public

A public PromptQL project is accessible to everyone.

If a `public` application is also set to JWT or Webhook mode, rather than `noAuth` mode, queries must include the JWT or
webhook authentication values to be successful.

Requests to a public application do not require the `x-hasura-ddn-token` header.

:::danger Public projects with noAuth mode

If set to `public` with `noAuth` mode, queries do not require any authentication and the application is fully public.

:::

## Changing the mode

### DDN CLI

Set to `private` mode:

```bash
ddn project set-api-access-mode private
```

Set to `public` mode:

```bash
ddn project set-api-access-mode public
```

### PromptQL Console

Click on the `Settings` gear icon in the bottom left of the sidebar navigation and then the `Summary` tab to access the
API access mode toggle.
