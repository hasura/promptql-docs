# PromptQL Playground Auth

You can check the auth which the PromptQL Playground client is using by clicking the Auth button on the left-hand side
of the chat dialogue.

## Configure headers

In the headers tab you will be able to see the key value pairs of the headers which are being sent to the engine for
each request.

You can also add custom headers to the request by clicking the `+` button.

:::info Reserved headers

The `x-hasura-ddn-token` header is automatically added by the PromptQL Playground client and should not be modified. If
passing a custom JWT in [JWT mode](/auth/jwt/jwt-mode.mdx) it should be set with another `x-hasura-*` header key.

## Authorization

The `Authorization` tab shows the current authorization mode, current user role, and will show any values of session
variables if there are any set.
