# How to Talk to PromptQL

## Introduction

Talking to PromptQL is like onboarding a new teammate. It starts with limited knowledge—your Day-0 analyst, engineer, or
ops assistant—and learns quickly through the questions you ask and the feedback you provide. The more you interact with
it, the sharper and more context-aware it becomes. Your conversations aren't just about getting answers—they’re also
shaping how PromptQL thinks about your business, your data, and your language.

## Do's

PromptQL works best when you treat it like a collaborator. Ask specific questions in natural language. There's no need
to speak in SQL or use exact technical phrases. Just describe what you’re curious about.

Examples:

```plaintext
Compare signups this quarter to last.
Show me churn by region.
Break this down by customer type.
```

It helps to add context, especially for company-specific terms, business rules, or timeframes. PromptQL will do its best
to infer meaning, but your clarification speeds things up and improves accuracy.

As you go, don’t hold back feedback. If an answer is off, say so. Corrections make it smarter. You can say:

```plaintext
That’s not what I meant.
Can you explain how you got this?
Try grouping it by year instead.
Our fiscal year starts in February.
```

The more you interact, the better PromptQL gets at understanding your definitions, your patterns, and your expectations.
It remembers what you correct. It learns how you ask.

You can also ask for visualizations, request alternate views of the same data, or specify how you'd like results
returned:

```plaintext
Show a chart of the trend.
Group by location and limit to the top 10.
```

If you're unsure about terminology, just ask. PromptQL can define terms or explain metrics. It’s built to clarify, not
confuse.

## Don'ts

Don’t expect one-shot perfection in the beginning. PromptQL thrives in back-and-forth exchanges. It doesn't retain prior
conversation context unless you reference it, so always restate key details when continuing a line of inquiry or use an
artifact to start a new chat.

Avoid assuming it can access anything outside of your connected schema. It can’t pull in external files, ping APIs, or
generate real-world updates from news or financial markets...unless you've added this functionality!

You _should_ use niche or complex domain terms—just be ready to explain them the first time. This helps PromptQL learn
your vocabulary and makes future conversations smoother. If it gets something wrong:

```plaintext
That’s not what “churn risk” means for us.
In our case, “premium” refers to the paid tier only.
```

This is how PromptQL builds context over time, adapting to your business.

## Next Steps

The best way to get started is to ask something simple but real. Start with a metric you track regularly, or recreate an
analysis you've done manually before. From there, PromptQL will learn your expectations, surface useful patterns, and
help you turn those insights into reliable, repeatable workflows.
