# Deployment Overview

Deploying to Hasura DDN is the optimal way to enable PromptQL to accurately talk to all your data. Hasura DDN provides
the data foundation that powers PromptQL's intelligent data interaction capabilities. For more details on dedicated
infrastructure, see [Hasura Private DDN](/private-ddn/index.mdx). For more details on pricing plans, see
[our pricing page](https://hasura.io/pricing).

## Hasura DDN

With Hasura DDN, PromptQL runs in a globally-distributed cloud where performance, availability, and security are handled
for you.

To deploy your PromptQL project, you will create builds of your connectors, subgraphs, and the supergraph. This can all
be done in a single command. You will then apply the supergraph build to your project, making it the "official" build
for the project.

PromptQL will use this supergraph to facilitate AI-powered conversations with your data, generating dynamic query plans
that can access and analyze information across all your connected data sources.

## Next steps

Use the How To guide for the most common steps to deploy your PromptQL project to DDN. Try the tutorial for more
detailed steps depending on your specific connector.
