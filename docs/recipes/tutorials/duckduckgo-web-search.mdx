# AI Assistant for DuckDuckGo Web Search with Agentic Query Planning

Supports web search in realtime to query DuckDuckGo and return a list of search results that PromptQL can operate on.

- Query for keywords (including multiple at the same time)
- Can return a maximum of 20 results for each keyword.
- Uses the "us-en" region as default, but can be changed.

In this guide, you will learn how to setup DuckDuckGo web search functionality and connect it to PromptQL to be able to
query using natural language and perform programmatic analysis or computation on search results.

Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hasura/duckduckgo-search).

<Prereqs />

## Setup DuckDuckGo Search Connector

**Step 1: Clone the project**

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:hasura/duckduckgo-search.git
cd duckduckgo-search
```

**Step 2: Introspect the DuckDuckGo Connector**

```ddn
ddn connector introspect duckduckgo --log-level=DEBUG
```

The above command runs in DEBUG mode to make it easy to catch errors in case there are any issues.

**Step 3: Add Commands**

Let's track all the commands that enable web search on DuckDuckGo to get started quickly.

```ddn
ddn model add duckduckgo "*"
```

## Build your PromptQL app

Now, let's set up the Hasura DDN project with PromptQL to start exploring the data in natural language!

- Set up the Hasura DDN project already scaffolded in the repo:

In the root directory of the repo, run the following commands:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build local
ddn project init
```

- Start the DDN project

Let's start the DDN project by executing the following command:

```ddn
ddn run docker-start
```

- Open the local DDN Console to start exploring:

```ddn
ddn console --local
```

This should open up your browser (or print a browser URL) for displaying the Hasura Console. Itâ€™ll typically be
something like:
[https://promptql.console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282](https://promptql.console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282)

## Ask questions with access to DuckDuckGo search

The app will have metadata about the web search functionality of DuckDuckGo.

Here's a sample of what you can ask to get started.

- Hi, what can you do? (PromptQL will tell you what it can answer and you can go from there)
- give me just the URLs and title tags for the top 20 results ranking for the keyword "hasura".
- summarize the top 3 results for "promptql"
- for "promptql", classify the results as informational or product intent.
