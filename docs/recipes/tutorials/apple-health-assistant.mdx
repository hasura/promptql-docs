# Apple Health Assistant

In this guide, you will learn how to set up an Apple Health Assistant using PromptQL and Hasura. This assistant empowers
you to analyze your own Apple Health data by interacting in natural language. You’ll import your health metrics from an
iPhone into a PostgreSQL database, connect it with PromptQL, and interact with the data.

Here’s a sample conversation:

## Export your Apple Health Data

This is a private health assistant and it relies on the Apple Health data of the user. In order to export the Health
data from your iPhone, follow the instructions below:

- Go to the Health app on your iPhone.
- Tap your picture or initials at the top right.
- If you don’t see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom of the screen, then scroll to the top
  of the screen.
- Tap Export All Health Data, then choose a method for sharing your data. If you have a Macbook, share it via AirDrop to
  get started quickly. Otherwise, use Google Drive to save and download.

Here are the docs on
[Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-your-health-data-iph5ede58c3d/ios#iphe962dcbd2) around
this. Do note that the export can take some time depending on how much data you have. Ensure your phone doesn't lock
during the export to prevent interruption.

## Import your Apple Health data into PostgreSQL

Step 1: Clone the project

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:praveenweb/apple-health-ai-assistant.git
cd apple-health-ai-assistant
```

Step 2: Copy Apple Health export.zip

Copy the `export.zip` file obtained from the Apple Health export above into the root directory of the git repo you just
cloned.

Step 3: Configure environment variables

```bash copy
cp .env.sample .env
```

The default Postgres credentials should work. Feel free to change them as necessary.

Step 4: Start the data import using docker compose

```bash copy
docker compose up -d –build
```

This should run the Python program, which takes in the `export.zip` that was placed in the root directory, unpacks and
parses the XML data, and inserts it into the PostgreSQL database.

**Note**: Depending on how big your health export is, it should take anywhere between 30 seconds to 2 minutes to fully
import the data. The schema will be initialized quickly and the data import happens in the background, so you can
proceed to follow the steps below.

## Build your PromptQL app

Now, let's set up the Hasura DDN project with PromptQL to start exploring the data in natural language!

- Set up the Hasura DDN project already scaffolded in the repo:

```bash copy
cd ddn-project
ddn supergraph build local
ddn project init
```

- Add Anthropic API key to the`.env`.

Get an api key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

```.env file
...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>
```

To use an OpenAI API key instead, you’ll have to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` key-value in your `.env` file and change the
environment variable LLM to `openai` in the compose.yaml file.

- Start the DDN project

Let's start the DDN project by executing the following command:

```ddn
ddn run docker-start
```

- Open the local DDN Console to start exploring:

```ddn
ddn console --local
```

This should open up your browser (or print a browser URL) for displaying the Hasura Console. It’ll typically be
something like:
[https://console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282](https://console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282)

## Ask questions about personal health

The app has metadata about various health metrics and it can answer a range of questions; as simple as "What’s my step
count per day?" to as complicated as, "Give me a nutrition plan based on my weight / BMR, activity and heart health to
reduce 1 pound every 2 weeks."

Here's a sample of what you can ask:

- What's my average walking per day?
- How much time am I spending outdoors?
- Based on my weight and BMR, tell me if I'm on track to lose weight and what should my calorie intake be for losing 1
  pound per week. Analyze data over the last 3 months.
- Am I being exposed to a lot of noise in the environment? Check the impact on my hearing health.
- How is my heart health?
- How active have I been over the last few months? Are there any patterns and anomalies in my activity?
- How much exercise activity did I do in the last year? What's the trend looking like?

## Clean up and restart your app

If you want to reset the Apple Health data and start from scratch, you can execute the following in the root directory
of the repo:

```bash copy
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d --build
```

## Interactive demo

Here is an interactive demo of the AI Assistant. We'll start by looking at the exported data and then talk to it with
PromptQL! You can click the `Replay` button at any point to restart the demo.
