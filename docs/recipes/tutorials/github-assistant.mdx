# GitHub Assistant

In this guide, you'll get hands on experience with PromptQL and the GitHub connector. We will be building a "Github
Issues" assistant.

You will learn how to:

- Set up PromptQL to work with a GitHub issues and pull requests.
  - You will be able to do natural language query to triage feature requests, bugs and other issues with your connected
    Github repository.
- Create and configure the necessary API keys.
- Run your PromptQL project in a local environment.
- Ask your questions with PromptQL playground.

<Prereqs />

## Build your PromptQL app

##ge# Clone the example project

The [example project](https://github.com/hasura/example-promptql-github) is already set up to connect PromptQL to any
GitHub repo.

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:hasura/example-promptql-github.git
cd example-promptql-github
```

### Set up your .env file

Set up your .env file with your GitHub API token.

```bash copy
cp .env.example .env
```

**Add GitHub API token to .env**

For the Github integration. Create an API token from https://github.com/settings/tokens

```bash
# .env

...
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<GITHUB_API_TOKEN>
```

This token only needs read access to the repo you are interested in.

### Set up your GitHub repo

Head to `app/connector/github/index.ts` and change the org name and the repo name to something you'd like:

```typescript
// index.ts

...
  const manager = new GitHubIssueSyncManager('<org-name>', '<repo-name>');
  if (!process.env.GITHUB_API_TOKEN) {
...
```

### Setup your DDN project

This will create a Hasura DDN cloud project and set up PromptQL keys to connect to the PromptQL runtime.

```ddn
# If you don't have a data plane provisioned, please contact your AI strategist
ddn project init --data-plane-id <your-data-plane-id>
```

### Fire up your PromptQL project

Build your supergraph.

```ddn
ddn supergraph build local
```

Then bring up the PromptQL API server, the engine and the connector

```ddn
ddn run docker-start
```

You'll notice in amongst your Docker logs that your github synchronization has started.

<details>
  <summary>Docker logs</summary>
  [2024-01-01 12:00:01] Starting GitHub sync...
  <br />
  [2024-01-01 12:00:02] Fetching repository metadata...

  <br />
  [2024-01-01 12:00:05] GitHub sync complete
</details>

If the specified repo has many issues or comments it may take some time to get them all and you may be rate limited.
That's ok, you can go ahead and try PromptQL without the process having fully finished yet.

If you notice some logs regarding GitHub permissions, check that your GitHub API token has the correct permissions for
the repo you're trying to access.

### Restarting the app

If you made a mis-step or want to start from scratch, simply restarting the docker containers will reset all state
including any loaded data.

```ddn
ddn run docker-start
```

## Act on your data

### Open the PromptQL playground

In another terminal, run

```ddn
ddn console --local
```

### Ask questions about your GitHub repo

The console is a web app hosted at console.hasura.io that connects to your local PromptQL API and data sources. Your
data is processed in the DDN PromptQL runtime but isn't persisted externally.

Head over to the console and ask a few questions about your GitHub repo.

```text copy
> What are the open pull requests?
> What kind of questions can I ask?
```
