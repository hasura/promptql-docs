# AI Assistant for BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit)

This is a simple example of exposing PromptQL to real-time public data using the BART API. The BART API is a public API
that provides real-time data on the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. This example demonstrates how to use PromptQL to
create a real-time chat application that allows a user to talk to the BART API and get real-time information on
departures.

Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/robertjdominguez/example-promptql-bart).

Here's a sample of what you can ask:

- What time is the next train arriving at Embarcadero?
- If I leave 576 Folsom St now, can I make the next train at Montgomery?

## Setup the Bart API

**Step 1: Clone the project**

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:robertjdominguez/example-promptql-bart.git
cd example-promptql-bart
```

**Step 2: Add Anthropic API key to .env**

Set up your .env file with your Anthropic (or OpenAI) API key and GitHub API token.

```bash copy
cp .env.example .env
```

Get an api key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

```bash
# .env
...
...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>
```

To use an OpenAI key instead, you'll have to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your .env file and change the environment variable
`LLM` to `openai` in the compose.yaml file.

## Build your PromptQL app

Now, let's set up the Hasura DDN project with PromptQL to start exploring the data in natural language!

- Set up the Hasura DDN project already scaffolded in the repo:

In the root directory of the repo, run the following commands:

```ddn
ddn project init
```

Create a build:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build local
```

- Start the DDN project

Let's start the DDN project by executing the following command:

```ddn
ddn run docker-start
```

- Open the local DDN Console to start exploring:

```ddn
ddn console --local
```

This should open up your browser (or print a browser URL) for displaying the Hasura Console. Itâ€™ll typically be
something like:
[https://console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282](https://console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282)
