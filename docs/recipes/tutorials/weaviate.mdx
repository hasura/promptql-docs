# Add Support for Weaviate

## Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to connect your Weaviate cluster and perform semantic search with PromptQL.

## Prerequisites

In this example, we'll use a Weaviate Cluster on Cloud.

1. Create a cluster on Weaviate
2. You will need the Weaviate REST API URL and API Key, both available on Weaviate Cloud.
3. You'll also need a Cohere API key for the embeddings.

## Tutorial

### Step 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hasura/weaviate-promptql-quickstart.git
cd promptql-weaviate-quickstart
```

### Step 2. Add your API keys for Weaviate and Cohere

We'll be using the Cohere API key to create embeddings for our unstructured data via Weaviate Client. We also need the
Weaviate Cloud URL and Weaviate API Key. Both can be obtained from Weaviate Cloud.

In your project directory, add the key to your `.env` file.

First, copy the `env.sample` file to `.env`

```sh
cp env.sample .env
```

```sh title="Now, update the API keys:"
APP_PYTHON_COHERE_API_KEY='....'
APP_PYTHON_WCD_URL='....'
APP_PYTHON_WCD_API_KEY='....'
```

:::info Embeddings are up to you

Feel free to modify the embedding configuration in Weaviate Client to use something other than Cohere and configure the
API key accordingly.

:::

### Step 3. Create a collection and load data

After configuring the `.env` values with the above credentials, continue with the data loading into Weaviate.

```sh title="Head to app/connector/python and execute:"
python3 load-data.py
```

This will create a movie collection and load sample movie data with vector embedding using Cohere.

### Step 4. Write custom functions

In `app/connector/python/functions.py`, we already have two functions:

- `semantic_search`
- `keyword_search`

They are exposed as functions to PromptQL. Add more per your requirements.

```python copy

functions.py

This is an example of how you can use the Python SDK's built-in Function connector to easily write Python code.
When you add a Python Lambda connector to your Hasura project, this file is generated for you!

In this file you'll find code examples that will help you get up to speed with the usage of the Hasura lambda connector.
If you are an old pro and already know what is going on you can get rid of these example functions and start writing your own code.

### Step 5. Build your supergraph

```ddn title="Create your supergraph build locally:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

```ddn title="Run the services:"
ddn run docker-start
```

### Step 6. Head to your local DDN console

```ddn title="Run the following from your project's directory:"
ddn console --local
```

### Step 7. Talk to your data

```text title="Now, you can ask semantic questions on your data:"
Movies with dystopian future
Historical movies
```
