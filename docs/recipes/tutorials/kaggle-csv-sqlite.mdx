# Import Kaggle Datasets | CSV, SQLite

In this guide, you will learn how to import any dataset from Kaggle (like CSV, and SQLite files) and connect it to
PromptQL to be able to query using natural language.

Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hasura/kaggle-dataset-promptql).

<Prereqs />

## Import your Kaggle Dataset

**Step 1: Clone the project**

```bash copy
git clone git@github.com:hasura/kaggle-dataset-promptql.git
cd kaggle-dataset-promptql
```

**Step 2: Get the Kaggle Credentials and Dataset Identifier**

To get the Username and Key, go to the 'Account' tab of your Kaggle user profile and select 'Create New Token'. This
will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your API credentials.

In order to import the dataset, we need to configure the Identifier of the dataset.

For example, here's an IMDB dataset -
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).
Now the Kaggle Identifier for this would be something like:

```bash copy
rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
```

Replace this with the identifier of choice. This should work for any ".csv", or ".sqlite" files in Kaggle.

**Step 3: Configure .env for kaggle**

Head to the `app/connector/kaggle` directory to now configure the Dataset.

```bash copy
cd app/connector/kaggle
cp .env.sample .env
```

Modify the values for the `KAGGLE_IDENTIFIER` ENV and add the values for `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY` environment
variables obtained from the previous step from the token download.

For example:

```bash copy
KAGGLE_USERNAME="<your_username>"
KAGGLE_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
KAGGLE_IDENTIFIER="rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset"
```

The IMDB example mentioned in the sample env is available as a sample dataset to choose. Feel free to configure the
dataset that you would like to.

**Step 4: Introspect the Kaggle Connector**

```ddn
ddn connector introspect kaggle --log-level=DEBUG
```

**Note**: Depending on how big the dataset is, it should take sometime to fully import the data. The schema will be
initialized quickly and the data import happens in the background, so you can proceed to follow the steps below in a
different terminal window.

The above command runs in DEBUG mode to make it easy to catch errors for invalid files.

**Step 5: Add Models**

Based on the dataset imported, a SQL schema would be generated. Let's track all the models to get started quickly.

```ddn
ddn model add kaggle "*"
```

## Build your PromptQL app

Now, let's set up the Hasura DDN project with PromptQL to start exploring the data in natural language!

- Set up the Hasura DDN project already scaffolded in the repo:

In the root directory of the repo, run the following commands:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build local
ddn project init --with-promptql
```

- Start the DDN project

Let's start the DDN project by executing the following command:

```ddn
ddn run docker-start
```

- Open the local DDN Console to start exploring:

```ddn
ddn console --local
```

This should open up your browser (or print a browser URL) for displaying the Hasura Console. Itâ€™ll typically be
something like:
[https://promptql.console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282](https://promptql.console.hasura.io/local?engine=localhost:3280&promptql=localhost:3282)

## Ask questions about your dataset

The app will have metadata about the dataset that you just imported above. You should be able to ask domain specific
questions and play around with the data.

Here's a sample of what you can ask to get started.

- Hi, what can you do?

Depending on the dataset schema, PromptQL will tell you what it can answer and you can go from there.

## Clean up and restart your app

If you want to reset the data and start from scratch:

You can stop the `ddn run docker-start` command, whereever it is running and you can execute the following in the root
directory of the repo:

```bash copy
docker compose down -v && ddn run docker-start
```
