# Help and Support Overview

## Self-Serve Options

### Explore the docs

Start by exploring our [quickstart guide](/quickstart.mdx) to get up and running with PromptQL or dive into the
[tutorials](/how-to-build-with-promptql/index.mdx) for a step-by-step approach to connect PromptQL to your data sources.
Once you're comfortable, expand your knowledge with sections like [data sources](data-sources/index.mdx),
[data modeling](data-modeling/index.mdx), [auth](auth/index.mdx), and [deployment](deployment/index.mdx) to enhance how
PromptQL interacts with your data.

### Ask the community

- We have a forum where you can ask questions and get help from the community and Hasura employees.
  [Join here](https://forum.hasura.io).
- Additionally, you can create a GitHub issue for any bugs or feature requests
  [here](https://github.com/hasura/promptql-bug-tracker/issues/new/choose).

## Enterprise clients
