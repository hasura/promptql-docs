# Help and Support Overview

## Self-Serve Options

### Explore the docs

Start by exploring our [quickstart guide](/quickstart.mdx) to get up and running with PromptQL or dive into the
[tutorials](/how-to-build-with-promptql/overview.mdx) for a step-by-step approach to connect PromptQL to your data
sources. Once you're comfortable, expand your knowledge with sections like [data sources](data-sources/overview.mdx),
[data modeling](data-modeling/overview.mdx), [auth](auth/overview.mdx), and [deployment](deployment/overview.mdx) to
enhance how PromptQL interacts with your data.

### Ask the community

- We have a forum where you can ask questions and get help from the community and Hasura employees. [Join here](#).
- Additionally, you can create a GitHub issue for any bugs or feature requests
  [here](https://github.com/hasura/promptql/issues).

## Enterprise clients

If you have a paid plan or a dedicated Enterprise contract, you can
[ask the support team for help](https://hasurahelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
