# Artifacts

## Introduction

Artifacts are reusable outputs generated by programs in the Playground. They allow you to reference, inspect, and reuse
results such as text, tables, and visualizations across interactions.

When a program returns a supported output type, PromptQL automatically stores it as an artifact. These artifacts can
then be linked across steps in a thread, reused in new instructions, or exported for use elsewhere.

## Types of artifacts

### TextArtifact

**Type**: `"text"`  
**Data shape**: `string`

Text artifacts store plain text — like summaries, explanations, or generated responses. They're ideal for lightweight
results that don’t require structure or formatting. In the Playground, a short preview is shown to help you quickly
identify the content.

For example, if a program returns a single paragraph explaining a dataset, PromptQL will save that result as a
`TextArtifact`.

### TableArtifact

**Type**: `"table"`  
**Data shape**: `list of objects`, where each object represents a row and keys are column names

Table artifacts are used for structured data. Whether you're returning a list of users, products, or any tabular output,
the system recognizes it and saves it as a `TableArtifact`.

In the Playground, you'll see the number of rows and a small sample preview. This is useful for quickly scanning the
data before diving deeper or using it as input to a follow-up question.

### VisualizationArtifact

**Type**: `"visualization"`  
**Data shape**: an object containing:

- `html`: string of rendered visualization markup
- `visualization_data`: the structured data used to create the visualization

Visualization artifacts are built for more expressive output — like charts, graphs, or custom visuals. When a program
returns a visualization with HTML and data, it’s stored as a `VisualizationArtifact`, enabling rich visual exploration
directly in the Playground.

In the interface, the visualization is rendered from the HTML output, giving you a visual snapshot of your program’s
result.

## Exporting artifacts

Each artifact contains set of three options for exporting data.

### Copy data

The first allows you to copy the raw data. For text artifacts, this is simply a string of text; for table artifacts,
it's an array of JSON objects; and for visualization artifacts, this is the HTML of the visualization in addition to the
JSON of the underlying and visualized data.

### Download data

The download option is identical to the copy option, but provides a context-appropriate file type (e.g., tables are
represented as CSV files).

### Download artifact definition

The artifact definition option provides a JSON file for each artifact that provides additional information, such as the
identifier, along with the artifact's raw data.

:::info reuse artifacts

You can reuse artifacts via the PromptQL Playground; look for the share icon in the top-right corner of an artifact to
reuse it in a new thread.
