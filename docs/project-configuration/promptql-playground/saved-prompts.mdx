# Saved Prompts

Saved and Shareable Prompts allow you to streamline collaboration and user onboarding in PromptQL projects. By appending
a predefined prompt to a URL, you can guide users directly into a conversation with the prompt pre-filled in the input
chat box, ready for execution.

## How It Works

Saved and Shareable Prompts utilize URL parameters to embed predefined prompts within a link. When a user clicks the
link, the specified prompt is automatically loaded into the chat box, ensuring a seamless experience.

## URL Format

To create a shareable prompt, append the prompt query parameter to a PromptQL playground URL:

```code
https://promptql.console.hasura.io/public/<your_project>/playground?prompt=<encoded_prompt>
```

For example:

```code
https://promptql.console.hasura.io/public/duckduckgo/playground?prompt=find%20the%20top%2010%20results%20for%20hasura
```

In this case, the prompt `find the top 10 results for hasura` is URL-encoded and pre-filled in the chat input when the
link is opened.

## URL Encoding

Special characters in the prompt are automatically escaped to ensure proper functionality. This ensures that even
complex prompts with spaces or special symbols can be shared without issues.
