# Threads

Threads are the conversations you have with your data. They are the backbone of the PromptQL Playground and are how you
interact with your data.

In this section, you'll find tutorials that walk you through some common use cases and best practices for using threads.
Initially, we recommend checking out common use cases:

- [Share a thread](/project-configuration/promptql-playground/threads/1-shared-threads.mdx)
- [Thread titles](/project-configuration/promptql-playground/threads/3-thread-titles.mdx)
- [Pin thread](/project-configuration/promptql-playground/threads/4-pin-thread.mdx)
- [Delete thread](/project-configuration/promptql-playground/threads/5-delete-thread.mdx)

For admin features like playground thread history, see the [Observability section](/observability/playground-history).
