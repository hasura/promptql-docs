# Project READMEs

## Introduction

Project READMEs serve as the central documentation hub for your PromptQL projects. Similar to GitHub READMEs, they
provide essential information about your project, guiding users on how to effectively interact with your PromptQL
implementation.

READMEs are especially valuable for public projects, as they're the first thing users see when accessing your project
through a shared URL. They help set expectations, provide context, and offer guidance on how to get the most out of your
PromptQL project.

## Purpose and benefits

Project READMEs serve multiple important purposes:

- **Project Overview**: Provide a clear description of what your project does and its intended use cases
- **Usage Guidelines**: Explain how to effectively interact with your PromptQL implementation
- **Prompt Ideas**: Suggest example prompts that showcase your project's capabilities
- **Data Context**: Describe the data sources connected to your project and how they can be queried
- **Best Practices**: Share tips for getting optimal results from your PromptQL implementation
- **Documentation**: Link to additional resources or documentation related to your project

## Who can edit READMEs?

Access to edit project READMEs is restricted to:

- **Project Administrators**: Users with administrative privileges for the project
- **Project Collaborators**: Team members who have been granted collaborator access

This restricted access ensures that only authorized users can modify the project's documentation, maintaining quality
and accuracy.

## Creating and editing a README

### Step 1. Navigate to the README section

In your PromptQL project, locate and click on the "README" section in the project sidebar.

### Step 2. Edit your README content

The README editor supports Markdown formatting, allowing you to create rich, well-structured documentation:

- Use headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to organize your content
- Create lists with bullet points (`-`) or numbers (`1.`, `2.`, etc.)
- Add emphasis with **bold** or _italic_ text
- Include code blocks with triple backticks (```)
- Add links to external resources with `[text](url)`

### Step 3. Save your changes

After editing your README, click the "Save" button to publish your changes. Your README will immediately be visible to
all users with access to your project.

## Best Practices

To create an effective README for your PromptQL project:

1. **Start with a Clear Introduction**: Explain what your project does and its primary purpose
2. **Include Example Prompts**: Provide sample prompts that demonstrate different capabilities
3. **Explain Data Context**: Describe the data sources and how they relate to each other
4. **Keep It Updated**: Regularly update your README as your project evolves
5. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a consistent structure and style throughout
6. **Consider Your Audience**: Write with your intended users in mind, adjusting technical detail accordingly

## Viewing READMEs

For public projects, the README is prominently displayed when users access your project through its public URL. For
private projects, the README is visible to all project members and collaborators.

The README serves as the landing page for your project, making it the ideal place to provide a comprehensive overview
and guide for users.

:::tip Think of your README as your project's homepage It's often the first impression users will have of your project,
so invest time in making it informative and engaging. :::
