# Providers & Models

## Introduction

PromptQL supports configuring different LLM providers and models to tailor the experience to your application's needs.

This gives you the flexibility to choose the most performance-efficient and cost-effective solution for your use case,
and the freedom to switch between providers and models as needed depending the task.

For example, you can use one model for conversational tasks and another for advanced AI primitives:

```yaml {5-6,8-9}
kind: PromptQlConfig
version: v1
definition:
  llm:
    provider: openai
    model: o3-mini
  ai_primitives_llm:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
```

### `llm`

The `llm` configuration is used to define the LLM provider and model for **conversational tasks** in your application.
In the example above, we're using `openai` as the provider with the `o3-mini` model.

### `ai_primitives_llm`

The `ai_primitives_llm` configuration is used to define the LLM provider and model for
[**AI primitives** in your application](/promptql-apis/execute-program-api.mdx). This is used for tasks such as
**program generation and execution**. In the example above, we're using `openai` as the provider with the `gpt-4o`
model.

## Available providers and models

Here are the currently supported providers and their available models:

| Provider    | Supported Models                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `hasura`    | N/A _(uses default internally)_ |
| `openai`    | `o1`, `o3-mini`, `gpt-4o`       |
| `anthropic` | `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`      |

:::info Base Model

When using the `hasura` provider, the default model is `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`. This is the recommended model for
PromptQL program generation.

:::

## Considerations

- The `model` key is **not supported** when using the `hasura` provider.
- If `ai_primitives_llm` is not defined, it defaults to the provider specified in the `llm` configuration.
- [`system_instructions` are optional](/project-configuration/promptql-config/system-instructions.mdx) but recommended
  to customize the behavior of your LLM.
