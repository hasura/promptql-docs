# Manage Multiple Environments

## Introduction

Managing multiple contexts in Hasura allows you to replicate the functionality of traditional environments like
`staging` and `production`, but with greater flexibility. Instead of rigidly-defined environments, your application uses
contexts to store key details such as project configurations, metadata, and environment variables. This approach lets
you switch between different setups without disrupting your workflow or end users.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Set up multiple contexts to test and collaborate on your project
- Use the CLI to manage your project's contexts
- Build and deploy projects with shared metadata across different contexts

This tutorial should take less than twenty minutes.

## Setup

### Step 1. Initialize a new local project

```ddn title="Create a new local project:"
ddn supergraph init environments-example --with-promptql && cd environments-example
```

This will scaffold out the necessary files for a project in a new `environments-example` directory.

### Step 2. Add a data source and seed data

In this tutorial, we'll use the PostgreSQL connector and a sample PostgreSQL database:

```plaintext
postgresql://read_only_user:readonlyuser@35.236.11.122:5432/v3-docs-sample-app
```

```ddn title="In your project directory, run the following, choose hasura/postrges, and pass the connection URI above when prompted:"
ddn connector init my_pg -i
```

### Step 3. Generate the Hasura metadata

```ddn title="Next, use the CLI to introspect the PostgreSQL database:"
ddn connector introspect my_pg
```

After running this, you should see a representation of your database's schema in the
`app/connector/my_pg/configuration.json` file; you can view this using `cat` or open the file in your editor.

```ddn title="Now, track the table from your PostgreSQL database as a model in your DDN metadata:"
ddn models add my_pg users
```

Open the `app/metadata` directory and you'll find a newly-generated file: `Users.hml`. The DDN CLI will use this Hasura
Metadata Language file to represent the `users` table from PostgreSQL in your API as a
[model](/reference/metadata-reference/models.mdx).

### Step 4. Create a new local build and test the API

```ddn title="To create a local build, run:"
ddn supergraph build local
```

The build is stored as a set of JSON files in `engine/build`.

```ddn title="Start your local Hasura instance and PostgreSQL connector:"
ddn run docker-start
```

Your terminal will be taken over by logs for the different services.

```ddn title="In a new terminal tab, open your local console:"
ddn console --local
```

You can now query it using the PromptQL Playground.

## Create a new context

### Step 5. Create a new project context and switch to it

```ddn title="From the project directory, run:"
ddn context create-context staging
```

Verify this by opening the `.hasura/context.yaml` file. You'll see a `contexts` array with two entries: `default` and
your newly-created `staging`.

:::tip What can be stored in context?

Contexts store a series of key-value pairs that make it easy to switch between different setups. You can learn more
[here](/project-configuration/project-management/manage-contexts.mdx).

### Step 6. Update the context values

```ddn title="First, set the supergraph configuration:"
ddn context set supergraph "supergraph.yaml"
```

```ddn title="Then, define which subgraphs to include:"
ddn context set subgraph "app/subgraph.yaml"
```

```sh title="Finally, stub out a local .env.staging file and add it to your staging context:"
touch .env.staging && ddn context set localEnvFile ".env.staging"
```

You'll see each of these key-value pairs added to your `staging` context.

:::tip Customize these values

The examples provided here are starting points and can be adapted to suit your project's requirements. Ideally, the
values included in your `.env.staging` file will reference resources such as testing database instances. Keep the keys
consistent with those in your production `.env` files, but assign different values tailored for staging or testing
environments.

:::

### Step 7. Create a new staging cloud project

```ddn title="Using your new context, create a cloud project:"
ddn project init --env-file-name ".env.staging.cloud"
```

The CLI will add the project's name and your `cloudEnvFile` to your `staging` context.

### Step 8. Create a new build on your staging project

```ddn
ddn supergraph build create
```

The CLI will output information about the build, including a PromptQL URL which you can open in your browser. Your local
metadata was used to create this build on your `staging` project.

### Step 9. Create a new build on your production project

```ddn title="First, switch contexts:"
ddn context set-current-context default
```

```ddn title="Since our current context is default, we can now use the same metadata to create a productioun build:"
ddn supergraph build create
```

Just as with our `staging` project, you can navigate to the PromptQL URL output by the CLI and explore your `production`
build, which should be identical to your `staging` build.

## Next steps

Now that you know how contexts can help you manage environments, see how easy it is to
[set up CI/CD](/deployment/hasura-ddn/ci-cd.mdx) using the CLI and contexts.
