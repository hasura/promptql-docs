# Manage Environment Variables

## Introduction

Environment variables are a crucial part of configuring your PromptQL project. They allow you to manage various
deployments of your application and its connectors. This guide covers how to manage environment variables at both the
project and connector levels, and how to collaborate effectively with your team.

## Project-level variables

Your project uses two main environment files:

1. `.env` - Used for local development
2. `.env.cloud` - Used for cloud deployments

The root-level `.env` file is automatically loaded by Docker Compose and contains variables that control your local
development environment. Key variables include:

- `HASURA_DDN_PAT` - Your Hasura Data Delivery Network Personal Access Token
- `PROMPTQL_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for PromptQL services
- `HASURA_DDN_URL` - URL for the Hasura Data Delivery Network
- `HASURA_LLM_URI` - URI for the LLM service
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - Allowed CORS origins for the playground
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - OpenTelemetry endpoint

The `.env.cloud` file follows the same structure but contains values specific to your cloud deployment. This separation
ensures that your local development environment remains isolated from production settings.

## Connector-level variables

Each connector in your project can define its own environment variables. These are prefixed with the subgraph name
(e.g., `APP`) followed by the connector name (e.g., `IMDB`). For example, from our [quickstart](/quickstart.mdx):

For the IMDB connector:

- `APP_IMDB_CONNECTION_URI`
- `APP_IMDB_HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `APP_IMDB_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
- `APP_IMDB_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`

For the PromptFlix connector:

- `APP_PROMPTFLIX_HASURA_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `APP_PROMPTFLIX_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
- `APP_PROMPTFLIX_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`

These variables are mapped in the respective `compose.yaml` files of each connector and are automatically loaded from
your root `.env` or `.env.cloud` file.

## Collaborate

When working with environment variables in a team setting:

1. **Never commit sensitive values**: Your `.env` and `.env.cloud` files should be in `.gitignore`
2. **Share template files**: Create `.env.example` and `.env.cloud.example` files that show the required variables
   without actual values
3. **Document requirements**: Use comments in your environment files to explain what each variable does
4. **Use consistent naming**: Follow the established naming conventions (e.g., `APP_` prefix for connector variables)
5. **Version control**: Keep your `.env.cloud` file in version control (without sensitive values) to track deployment
   configurations

## Add custom environment variables

The [`ddn connector env add` command](reference/cli/commands/ddn_connector_env_add.mdx) is a powerful tool that manages
environment variables across your entire project. When you add a variable using this command, it:

1. Updates your root-level environment variable files.
2. Ensures the variable is properly mapped in your connector's configuration.
3. Maintains consistency across your development and deployment environments.

### How it works

When you run the command, it performs several actions:

1. **Environment File Updates**: The command adds your variable to the specified environment file (defaulting to `.env`
   if not specified)
2. **Connector Configuration**: Updates the connector's configuration to recognize the new variable
3. **Subgraph Integration**: If specified, ensures the variable is properly integrated with your subgraph configuration

:::info Custom environment variables are often used with lambda connectors

While you can use this command to add custom environment variables to any connector, this is most often used with lambda
connectors which require environment variables for external services, sensitive keys, etc.

## Dynamic cloud variables

Some environment variables in your `.env.cloud` file are dynamic and will change with each new build or deployment.
These typically include:

- Connector read/write URLs
- Deployment-specific tokens
- Build-specific identifiers

### Managing dynamic variables

For production deployments, we strongly recommend using CI/CD pipelines to manage these dynamic variables. This ensures:

1. Variables are always up-to-date with the latest build
2. No conflicts between team members' local `.env.cloud` files
3. Consistent deployment configurations
4. Automated updates of dynamic values

### Handling local development

For local development with dynamic variables:

1. Use the development environment (`.env`) for most testing
2. Only use `.env.cloud` when testing production-specific features
3. Be aware that some features requiring dynamic URLs may not work locally
4. Use the development playground for testing instead of production endpoints

Remember that while you can manually update some values in `.env.cloud`, the dynamic variables should be managed through
your CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistency and prevent conflicts.
