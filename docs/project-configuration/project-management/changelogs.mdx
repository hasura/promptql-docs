# Managing Project Changelogs

## Overview

The Changelog feature in PromptQL helps you track and communicate changes to your project over time. This is especially
useful for teams where business users need to understand the current state of a project and its development history.

With changelogs, you can:

- Document what changes were made in each build
- Communicate updates to stakeholders
- Maintain a historical record of project evolution
- Provide context for data source additions, performance improvements, and bug fixes

The changelog feature is available through both the CLI and console interfaces.

:::tip Enable the feature flag

You can expose changelog entries to end users, visible in their chats via a badge in the top-right corner, by enabling
the `Changelog Badge` feature flag in `Settings > PromptQL > PromptQL Playground`.

## How to Use Changelogs

### Creating Changelog Entries

When you create and apply builds in your PromptQL project, changelog entries are automatically generated. The changelog
feature integrates seamlessly with your existing build workflow.

:::info Empty Changelog Entries

For applied builds that predate the Changelog feature, there are unpublished (and unversioned) entries for each.

:::

#### Automatic Changelog Generation

Create your build as usual:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build create
```

Then apply it:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build apply
```

This automatically creates a draft changelog entry with a calendar-based version number (CalVer), making it easy to
track when changes were made.

#### Viewing Changelog Entries

You can view all changelog entries using the changelog command:

```ddn
ddn changelog list
```

Or using the console's `Builds` page under the `Changelog` tab:

<Thumbnail src="/img/promptql-playground/changelog-list.png" alt="View all changelog entries" width="1000" />

#### Editing Draft Entries

Once you have a draft changelog entry, you can edit it using markdown formatting. This allows you to add detailed
information about what changed in your build.

**Example changelog content:**

```markdown
## New Data Sources

- Added new database tables for improved analytics
- Enhanced data access controls for better security
```

You can edit changelog entries using the CLI:

```ddn
ddn changelog edit v2025.09.26
```

As a project admin, you can also edit these entries from the console:

<Thumbnail src="/img/promptql-playground/changelog-edit.png" alt="Edit a changeloge entry" width="1000" />

When you publish an entry, it becomes visible to everyone in the project, providing transparency about what changes were
made. Non-admin users who navigate here can only see published entries and are unable to edit them.

### Publishing Changelog Entries Directly

For a streamlined workflow, you can create and publish changelog entries in a single step when applying builds.

#### Direct Publishing

Create a build:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build create
```

Apply it with changelog content:

```ddn
ddn supergraph build apply <build-version> --published --changelog-body "## Bug Fix üêõ\n- Fixed critical issue with data processing"
```

:::info Legacy control planes

If the project's control plane predates the addition of changelog functionality, the build will still be applied but
without the changelog content.

:::

This automatically generates and publishes the changelog entry with your content, making it immediately visible to all
project members.

## Changelog States

Changelog entries can exist in two states:

### Draft State

- Automatically created when you apply a build
- Only visible to project administrators
- Can be edited and modified before publishing
- Allows you to refine the content and add context

### Published State

- Visible to all project members from the `Changelog` tab of the `Builds` page
- Provides transparency about project changes
- Helps team members understand what changed and when

## Getting Started

### New Entries

To start using the changelog feature:

1. Ensure you're working with a PromptQL-enabled project
2. Update to the latest CLI version that supports changelog commands
3. Create and apply builds as usual - draft changelog entries will be automatically generated
4. Use `ddn changelog list` to view existing entries
5. Edit and publish changelog entries as needed

### Backfilling Entries {#backfilling-entries}

If your project existed before the addition of this feature, you have a catalog of unpublished and unversioned entries
for each applied build. You can use the `ddn changelog add` command to assign a version number to an entry and publish
it for historical context.

As an example, let's say a build was applied on 20 April, 2025 with build version `459514642a`. A historical changelog
entry could be generated for it like this:

```ddn
ddn changelog add 459514642a --version-number v2025.04.20
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Changelog Entries

- **Use clear, descriptive headings** to categorize changes (e.g., "New Features", "Performance Improvements", "Bug
  Fixes") as `##` second-level headings
- **Be specific about changes** - mention what was added, changed, or fixed
- **Consider your audience** - write for primarily non-technical team members
- **Include impact information** - explain how changes affect users or workflows

### Organizing Changelog Content

- Group related changes under appropriate headings
- Use bullet points for easy scanning
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Include relevant context when necessary
