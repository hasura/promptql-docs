# Project Management

## Introduction

Projects can be managed using several key tools: context, collaborators, and changelogs.

**Context** allows you to swap out local and cloud configuration files and values. This makes it easier to execute
commands via the CLI, switch between environments when testing your API, and executing automated CI/CD scripts.

**Collaborators** can be added to any [Hasura DDN Base or Hasura DDN Advanced project](https://hasura.io/pricing).
Depending on the project's plan, you can add collaborators with read-only access all the way to granular access,
enabling them to only contribute to certain [subgraphs](/project-configuration/subgraphs/index.mdx).

**Changelogs** help you track and communicate project changes over time, providing transparency about what was modified
in each build and maintaining a historical record of your project's evolution.
