# Supergraph

## Introduction

A supergraph is the foundation that enables PromptQL to accurately talk to all your data. It provides a unified
structure for your data sources, allowing PromptQL to generate insightful queries and visualizations through a natural
language conversation.

## Components

The supergraph is made up of several key components that work together to deliver a seamless data interaction
experience:

- **Subgraphs**: These represent different data domains and can include multiple data connectors to bring in data from
  various sources.
- **Builds**: A supergraph consists of immutable builds. At any given time, one build is applied, and it can be easily
  rolled back to a previous state if necessary.

## How it all works

The supergraph is defined using Hasura Metadata Language, which PromptQL uses to understand and interact with your data.
This metadata acts as the blueprint for everything, including:

- Defining roles and permissions to control access.
- Configuring authentication mechanisms.
- Defining relationships across and between data sources.

By centralizing these configurations, the supergraph ensures PromptQL can provide accurate insights and meaningful
visualizations from your data through natural conversations, enabling you to take action based on these insights.
